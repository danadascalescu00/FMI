# Problem Solving and Search

## Course Overview üìñ
The course is based on the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, and it focuses on problem-solving and search algorithms. The course is designed to provide students with an understanding of how search algorithms can be used in practical applications.

## Grading System üìä

The grade for the subject Problem Solving and Search is calculated by averaging the grades received for four projects presented during the semester. The projects consist of applications that use search algorithms as follows:

* **Project 1 -** an application that uses two uninformed search algorithms, as described on page 81 of the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach."
* **Project 2 -** an application that uses an informed search algorithm, as described on page 92 of the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach."
* **Project 3 -** an application that uses a local search algorithm, as described on page 120 of the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach."
* **Project 4 -** an application that uses an adversarial search algorithm, as described on page 120 of the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach."

## Projects Presentation üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
For each of the four projects, students are required to present and demonstrate their code in class, as well as the project documentation. The grade for the project will be based on the clarity of the presentation and the demonstration of the code. It is important to note that the implementation can be done in any programming language.
