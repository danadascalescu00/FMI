              "'\\n@@90398177 @5898177/ <h> Types of Squash Grips <p> Your racket will come with a stock factory grip . You can put an overgrip on top of that , to help with sweat absorption , or to increase the size of the grip and make the racket feel more comfortable in your freakishly large hands . <p> You can also buy a replacement grip . In this case you remove the factory grip and put on the replacement grip instead . <p> I generally only use overgrips . My favorite has always been Tourna Grip . here \\'s a video review I did of Tourna Grip , along with a brief tutorial on how to grip a squash racket . <p> I do n\\'t  use replacement grips too often but I \\'d have to guess the #1 brand of replacement squash grips is Karakal PU Super Grip . Tons of pros use Karakal . <p> Picking a grip is a very personal matter . Obviously , you need your squash racket to feel comfortable in your hands . So experiment with different squash grips and see what works best for you and your freakishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want to see the grip Ramy Ashour used to win the World Championships ? Sure you do . Here it is : <h> Comments <p> Here are some thoughts on grips . I have gone from replacement grips to overgrips . Overgrips are faster to change , cheaper , just as good tack and usually you can use both sides . These points mean that you can change it more often than replacement grips for the same money . I only buy thin overgrips so they will not effect the grip size much . <p> Karakal PU Supergrip . I used to grip my rackets with this , but honestly I do n\\'t  get the huge love people have for it . In my experience it initially has great tack , but it loses this great tackiness after the first matches and becomes just average quite fast . <p> Technifibre Absolut Squash replacement grip . Good initial tackiness and feel but looses its best feel and tackiness quite fast . Okay for sweaty hands , but not great . I would call it overall an \" okay \" product but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Shorbagy . <p> Tourna Grip overgrip . The initial tackiness is good , not great . Has a dry \" sandpaper-like \" feel and great durability . The best grip for sweaty hands , where the tackiness actually increases with a little moisture and does not get slippery from sweat . As a bonus you can use both sides of the grip like Wilson and Yonex . One of the best overgrips on the market . <p> Rab Reflex Dry Overgrip . Tries to emulate the Tourna grip but succeeds poorly . Low initial tackiness which gets just a little better with sweat/moisture . I can not recommend this product . <p> Wilson Pro overgrip . One of the best overgrips . Has a silky smooth feel , which is difficult to explain , with good tack . The smooth feel of this grip is probably its best trait . Okay for sweaty hands but not as good as Tourna . Average durability but you can use both sides , so a 3-pack actually becomes a 6-pack . Highly recommended <p> Yonex Super Grap overgrip . Quite similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as good for sweaty hands . Maybe looses its tackiness slightly faster than wilson , but overall a good overgrip . Average durability but you can use both sides . <p> Head Xtreme soft . Great initial tackiness . Has a nice rubbery feel and the neon yellow looks cool . Tackiness outlasts the Yonex and Wilson and has good durability . Slightly thicker than Yonex and Wilson . If you have sweaty hands it initially feels like it has good adsorbtion , but depending how much you sweat it will suddenly become very slippery . Only one-sided so you cant use it twice , but overall a good tacky grip but not for those who sweat alot from their hands . <p> Salming Extreme Sticky replacement grip and overgrip . Both the replacement- and overgrip feel quite similar except for the thickness . Very good tackiness and has a rubbery feel like the Head . Nice feel and looks cool and with average durability . Not the best choice for sweaty hands . Overall good products . <p> These are just how i myself feel about these grips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tested a bunch of other grips aswell but ill get to them another time . <p> I have tried , but not for long .

I actually have an Eye racket on hand but I put a Tourna Grip over it . Will take that off and see how it plays .

Why is this called the Vapor ? Its because when you slice this racket through the air , it leaves behind a trail of water vapor . Not from the racket itself , but from the eyes of your opponent , as they weep , softly . <h> Sponsored Links product i \\'d : 7014 <p> Its time to get irie with the newest design of Harrows best selling racquet around the world . With the same performance and playability that you have come to expect from the Vapor , this jammin makeover is sure to improve your game and style , mon . <p> Maybe this is the racket Bob Marley would have played squash with . Speaking of Bob Marley , did you ever watch the documentary called Marley ? At one point , his son Ziggy Marley tells this story of how Bob used to challenge his kids to running races , but instead of letting his kids win , Bob would run as FAST as he possibly could . You should watch the documentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ion Psx Element ( the black non Selby version ) . A tremendous blend of power , feel and durability . Ive been rotating through 3 of these rackets for the last 2 years and havent suffered any breakage or cracks . <p> Similar in terms of head shape and size but probably a fraction heavier . <p> On my scales the new white vapor is 10 grams lighter and has more of its weight in the head . The vapor is very \" smooth \" on contact with the ball , and going back to the XT feels really stiff ( but easier to generate pace with ) . <p> Just picked up a new Vapor and put it on my scale in stock configuration.barrage pro strings , and their PU gripcame in at 152g . Perhaps they added a bit more material to strengthen the newer mold to deal with some of the past breakage issues .. or I just got an outlier . <p> Yes , its made of graphite . Almost all squash rackets are made from graphite , except for a few heavy beginner rackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in their branding , but those rackets are also made of graphite . The Harrow Vapor is a high-end racket and I love it , but since this is to be your first racket , I recommend you find something less expensive to start with , something around US$100 . <p> Hi Pierre , thanks for the great squash website . The original Vapor also came in a pink and lime green version that they called The Prep , which has a paint scheme that the Ultralite Retro may be in homage towards . Its funny to think of 2006 as being retro , but hey , I guess in terms of rackets that \\'s a long time . Here are some links that I found in trying to learn more about The Prep which I recently bought a gently used version of on eBay for less than what it costs to have my rackets restrung . They are right when they call the Vapor \" extremely playable \" in the last paragraph of the article about Harrows Mark Hayden . <p> I know that the cosmetics have changed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the frame ( balance , weight , head-size , string pattern ) itself has remained primarily the same otherwise ? If so , I \\'d get another one , probably not for less than 40 dollars this time , but also probably not in pink either . <p> Thanks Dan , that was an interesting article on the Harrow founder . I \\'ve only played with the red and black Vapor I do n\\'t  know whether the models have changed much over the years . I understand that changing the paint job can have a subtle effect . <p> Hey , there is no difference between the new Misfit , and the previous red/black one . <p> I can also say that there was no difference between the red/ black one and the older model with the green at the top of the head ( I asked Harrow by email a few years ago ) . <p> Ive been playing with the Misfit one with the skull for over a year now . It apparently started as a custom paint job for a squash club . When Harrow had extras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they quickly sold out and more shipments were ordered . I \\'m guessing more than one club bought these , and they were so popular Harrow decided to make them standard . <p> I have both black/blue Misfit and black/red and play with them interchangeably . <p> I was told by the agent in the UK that the Red/Black Vapor had an improved balance and weight when compared to the lime/black model . <p> Thanks for clarifying the situation with the Misfit . It seems there is a premium for this racket over the red black Vapor so i wanted to make sure . <p> I have been using the Harrow Vapor since the dread model . All I noticed was the move from a gloss paint job to a mat finish with the racket remaining the same . <p> If I have one complaint they are rather fragile . Otherwise absolutely love them . Only other racket that cam close was the Dunlop Elite that let me down when the introduced the lime green version ( the one after the bronze version ) that was a very different racket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold my Head Rackets and now I \\'m \" heading \" to Harrow Rackets .

I have been an adidas stabil fan for years and have probably owned atleast one of every generation of stabil with the exception of the generation one boost . My first impression of the newer stabil boost 2 or stabil boost ii is a solid 8/10. i have only had the shoes for a 2 weeks now and only played 6 times in them however a few noteable differences in construction are quite pronounced . <p> First off the touge gap is quite large much larger then older stabil models i assume this is because adidas shoes tend to be tight fitting and not great for the wide footed players . Perhaps adidas thought that shortening the shoe sidewalls and increasing the size of the tounge gap would accomidate a larger foot ? What it has done is increase the span of the lace across the top of the shoe resulting in more lace and less shoe coming across the tounge . This is the biggest problem with the shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding laceeyeletts rippling out . You really have to pull on the laces to get the shoe snug and there is allot of pressure on the lace during play that is not absorbed well by the shoe which was likely the cause of the eyelett damage cited above . <p> On top of that vs the prior generation stabil the shoe wall construction looks and feels a bit thin specifically around the lace eyelets which the have attempted to reinforce with a think rubber peice which looks more to me like fashion vs function . <p> Adidas has to done a great job reinforcing the shoe from the outside . Heel support is amazing and side wall is very good .. Toe box is quite snug yet still comfortable . The redesigned toe box vs old stabils and gen 1 boosts is much better and seems to eliminate the wrinkles that occurred across the top of the toe box in other models . <p> The new sole grips well and the shoe weight seems inline ( or a bit lighter ) then other stabil models . While I \\'m not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shoe feels comfortable and supportive and responds well on court . <p> For me they felt a little bit to spongy . Furthermore the grip of the asics is better . The worst part is , that the holes for the laces tore off after just 3 weeks ( http : **27;36;TOOLONG I hope this is working ) . I returned them and try now salming . <p> Couple of guys on the club own these shoes . They seem to enjoy them and told me the fit was a little tighter around the foot . They compared it with the infamous Adipower Stabil 11 and seem to be content .

I am on my 4th pair , most recently I was looking at getting the Kobras but due to the -100+ price tag here in the UK I was put off , but managed to pick up the orange vipers for cheap so went with those . Theses arrived 1 month ago , and already showing significant wear on the toe and in step of the shoe . However , my previous vipers ( green ) went through the similar process , wear appears quickly on the upper but then does n\\'t  get too much worse . The problem I had was the sole , the in step wore down so much there was barely any rubber sole underneath my big toe ( these were bought in Jan 2016 and I had to ditch them by August ) . <p> However , I must say they are comfy and light and flexible . By far the best shoes Ive played in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their durability . <p> The Salming Vipers have a fatal flaw in that the sole is not one piece .

I \\'m on my 3rd pair of Race R1s within 18 months , which I think is pretty poor for the price <p> I \\'ve used the R1 , R9 and Viper . I completely agree with Piere , the Viper has a really low profile and therefore very little padding in the heel and ankle area . R1 shoes were incredibly comfortable .

I do n\\'t  know about the Kobra and Adder as they are not out yet . I \\'ve personally worn R1 , R2 and Viper . I feel Viper has the least padding so I \\'d rule that out for you . I could n\\'t detect a padding difference between R1 and R2 but I \\'ve heard some say R1 is a little better . Then within R1/R2 they have version numbers but I do n\\'t  believe there \\'s a big difference between the recent versions ( i.e. between 2.0 and 3.0 ) , so I \\'d just get whatevers available and looks coolest to you .

Not sure if they called them the Gel-Blast 7 because they only last 7 weeks , but it seems that way . Very bizarre considering that my last pair of Gel Rockets lasted me close to 2 years . I \\'m not exactly sure what compound they used for their rubber sole , but there \\'s no grip left on the front , inside portion of either shoe , and my left shoe has an obvious hole where there \\'s no longer any rubber . <p> I \\'m just happy that I got these on sale because I \\'d be pretty upset if I had paid more money for them . I guess they \\'re just going to be my backup pair and I \\'ll be switching companies if this is the best that Asics can do . <p> I should point out that I \\'m a runner , but I still expect a pair of shoes that retails for close to $200 Canadian with tax to last a bit longer than 2 months . A more traditional player would definitely have these last longer considering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they still look brand new . They just clearly werent designed to have a player that pushes off of their toes , laterally . <p> I bought a red pair of these in October . They \\'re stable , and I do like the feel of them even if they are a little heavy and warm . But , I play about 3 times a week and these shoes are basically destroyed by the end of January . Factor that I was gone for three weeks in November and did n\\'t  play for a week over Christmas and I would give these an F in durability . Both shoelaces broke within two months , both soles are worn through , the rubber on the front of my shoe is gone , and the front stitching is coming lose . I do n\\'t  play extremely competitively and these shouldve held up much longer . My previous Mizunos lasted 2 years and showed little wear . I even had a pair of Adidas running shoes last longer when I first started playing . With two months left in the season I \\'m ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed is the yellow outsole . The hexagon rubber stuff in the vamp held up great for me . I \\'d understand if just one thing wore out on them but the fact that laces and insoles cant last half the life of a shoe is a sign of poor quality control or extreme cost cutting measures . <p> I got the Gel Blast 7s back in June before the official release in most countries . They were for an uncle of mine who trusted I \\'d get him a good shoe . Seeing the pros coming out with GelBlast 7s at recent tournaments reassures me that I made a good decision . <p> Hi guys , bought the new blast 7s last week , will be trying them out this morning . For reference , I \\'ve previously used ( in order ) Asics Rocket , Progressive 2 , Fastball ( current ) . Ill report back later with a quick review . <p> I just bought a pair of these . they seem to look a little weird to me. the front tip of the shoe is not exactly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the middle tip is a little to the left and vise versa for the left shoe . is this on purpose ? <p> A squash pro friend of mine says these are not squash shoes . There \\'s not much info in the Gel Blast 7 , most refer to it as a court shoe . Are you ( or anyone ) able to she \\'d some light or share the experience playing with these ? <p> Its technically true Asics do not make squash shoes , they make shoes for handball , volleyball , and badminton . According to Asics , the Gel Blast range is supposed to a handball shoe , but they are appropriate for squash courts , meaning they are non-marking . Squash players have used them before ( e.g. Mathieu Castagnet has worn the Asics Gel Blast 6 ) . I have n\\'t seen anybody wearing the Gel Blast 7 yet , but its pretty new still , so hopefully well see some feedback in due course ! \\n@@90398194 @5898194/ <h> Old School Prince Extender OS Squash Rackets <p> Remember the Prince Extender ? This was the bomb racket in the late 90s . I think I mightve used the BIGBOY but I \\'m sure there was another model I used to roll with that Im forgetting the name of that had a red color scheme ( update : Jon reminds me it was called the Featherlite ) . <p> Incidentally , I am the proud owner , and CURRENT user of the Prince Extender OS Thunder . I purchased it circa 1997-1998. cant really remember to be honest.patent still pending at the time of purchase ! <p> In any case , it has served me well over the years . Used it againts pros . back in the day , and now its taking down \" grandpas \" at the club ! : <p> I have a Prince Extender OS featherlite in a maroon color , not red ; and yes I did find it in my closet . My squash days are over due to nerve problems in my feet . <p> It was a great piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post it on Ebay . There \\'s not a scratch on it ( it still has that holographic sticker in place ) so I \\'ll see if I can get a few bucks for it . I will send you a pic as well . <p> As a bit of a novice , I \\'ve started playing with my dads olds racket , an extended os destroyer . My question is , will playing with an older model like this be hampering my game ? Might I see an improvement if I use a more modern racket ? <p> No , if anything using an older ( usually heavier ) racquet will help your progression . The added weight helps guide the racquet through the swing , plus I always found a heavier racquet helps you remember proper pre-swing preperation . Not to mention older racquets seem to be alot less fragile . <p> I \\'m a beginner but I just bought a prince extender outrage for -3 from a charity shop . Played tonight and I beat my partner fir the first time in a few months . I \\'d say its the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchie you are thinking of the Featherlite . That was the lightest model they made at the time and had the red color scheme . I broke all of mine and then switched over Princes new Power Ring line by senior year . \\n@@90398196 @5898196/ 222379 @qwx842379 <p> In some of the pictures and videos , these shoes come out looking very red .

They were close to the great Asic progressive 2 ; s I used to wear , apart from the footbed gets really hot as there are no ventilation holes on the Salmings . <p> Unfortunately , I cant get hold of them any more , seem to be replaced . Thinking of the Kobra but they are so expensive , I wonder how they compare . <p> I did a video comparing the Kobra vs the Race , you can check it out above or here . There are some slight differences but I liked them both . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been using it for a few weeks so I do n\\'t  know about the longevity . But in terms of how they feel on my feet , the Adder are a little closer to the Race . And they \\'re not exactly cheap but they \\'re less expensive than the Kobras . Might be worth a look . Thanks <p> Thanks Pierre , I have watched both your videos now , great information in them . Slightly worried about the silly string loop design on the Kobra , so may go for the Adders this time and see how I get on . Many thanks for the great site . <p> Hi Pierre , a quick uodate , I ended up buying the Salming R9 mids and to me they feel super similar to the R2s , I cant even feel the difference . I am really pleased with them and have bought a spare pair as well.The extra height is minimal when I am playing . I did n\\'t  want to take a chance on the crazy expensive Race X , that has just been released . Thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tried size 8 in the Salming R2 and had heel pain . ( I \\'m guessing it must have been from friction ) I tried another pair of the most recent R2 in size 7.5 , and they fit me perfectly with no heel pain . For me they seem to run about a half size big . I love the grip they have on the floor . <p> I bought womens R5 which are almost same as these R2 . I found out that they were smaller than my other squash shoes ( 39 1/2 , others 40 ) . Shoes were very comfortable and light but I wore them out after a month , I train 6-10 times in week and had two tournaments . I have been using also adidas adipower stabil 11 ( also womens model ) and they have been lasted almost over year ! I hope salming could develop more sustainable shoes ! <p> I have seen many comments regarding the size of the shoes , I want to buy them online because i cant find them in my country , so I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Adidas adipower stabil 11 , size 11.5 US , can anyone tell me if the size of the Salming is similar to Adidas or should i buy a different size , otherwise I \\'ll buy again Adidas . Thank you <p> I wore the Adidas Adipower Stabil 10.1 in size 11.5 US , and now wear the Salming Race R2 also in 11.5 . I am happy with the 11.5 size . The Race R2 feels a little wider than the Adipower to me . I think I probably could have been equally happy with size 11 Salmings ( which I never tried onlike you , I ordered them from another country ) . Hope that helps . <p> now , after 9 month playsing Squash with the Salming , I have no grip anymore on my Salming R2 2.0 , but the shoe is very very durable , I \\'ve played 4-6 times a week ( 10-15 h ) , here you could see some picture of my shoes now : <p> My Ascics Gel Blade 4 was wonderful , great shoe and very wonderful , but after 3-4 month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the upper shoe components , a lot of holes : - ( ( ( <p> Now I \\'ve bought the Asics Gel Blade 5 for 69 EUR ( in Germany ) , the Salming R2. 2.0 was sold out in my shop , if the shoe is similar durable as the Gel Blade 4 I would like to post the relevant infos . Probably I will order then online another pair of the Salming R2 2.0 , we will see . <p> I bought the R2 2.0 ( 74 EUR in Germany ) six month ago , and I am very pleased about this shoe . <p> Why : The shoe is very comfortable , light and the durability is unbelievable , I play 4-6 times a week ( 10-15 h / a week ) and my old Asics Gel Blade 4 lasts only 4 month , same procedure at my asics Gel Rocket 6 . <p> Based on some reviews ive ordered a half size smaller us size 10.5 of the Race1 2.0 blue ( usually 11 ) . And to my surprise both 10.5 and 11 are smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So i went to a store near by and got me Viper size 11.5 ( yes there \\'s a small gap between my fingers and the forefront ) but the shoes are perfect from the sides now . This is maybe due to having having a slightly wider feet than people who wear Adidas which is \" known of having shoes for narrow feet \" . Anyway , Since i have a history of ankle and knees injuries and was in store I \\'ve started trying different models R9 cushioning was the kind of shoe that perfect for my history but these were higher than the average squash shoes . Viper on the other foot ( bun intended ) were very low and you would be surprise of how low they are . But they have the widest gum rubber sole which is a plus for me in terms of stability on the court . <p> 1 . ive had them for a good while nowover 2 months and i play 3-4 nights a week and i \\'m no slouchi abuse the heck out of these and i only wear them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starbucks <p> 2. i ordered a half-size smaller on these and its perfect . <p> 3. 2 months later these puppies are holding their form and feel wonderful . in fact , ive ordered another pair just so i can have them at the ready and use them back and forth to save on wear and tear . <p> 4. they are the most comfortable squash shoe ive ever worn and i wont be going back to the asics or adidas. and not only that , they \\'re freakin cool lookingthe words squash shoes and stylish are not synonymous so that \\'s an added bonus . <p> Thanks for the review , in my opinion the R2 is not durable , after 1 month the shoe got Shredded from both side . Last week got The Salming Viper . Hopefully will last longer , otherwise will get back to Asics . <p> I can say without a doubt these feel remarkably better on my feet ( my opinion ) than the adidas adipower stabil . <p> for me , they have better arch and heel support . I get spells of plantar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively new adidas shoesthey just are n\\'t  for me . That said , I did order a half size smaller and glad i did .

See the PDF below for a sneak peek : <p> I am interested in buying either the Viper 2.0 or Viper 3.0 . I have previously played with the Asics Gel Blade 3 or 4 for the last 4 or 5 years but I understand that the latest Gel Blades are not as good . <p> Can anyone tell me if the Vipers are a close alternative to the Gel Blade 3 or 4 and also whether there is much improvement in the Viper 3.0 over the Viper 2.0 to justify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast 7s , which Salming shoe is closest to them in regards to comfort ? The gel blast wore out rather quickly , I \\'ve only had them for about 4 months and they \\'re already losing grip/worn out . <p> I \\'m looking for something that has good ankle support as well , I used my soles from my gel blast 5s in the 7s because the ankle support was horrendous with the soles of the 7 . I do n\\'t  want to pay top dollar for a salming shoe if it will wear out faster than the Asics or if it does not have good cushioning in addition to ankle support . <p> I am buying a pair for the first time for my husband . He has just started playing but I believe in buying the best . After reading the reviews here m pretty sure to buy salming . But could someone tell me the differnce in R2 3.0 and salming 91 . ?

These are launching in spring 2016 around the world . <p> This is a new frame design for Tecnifibre , with the strings looping around an arch in the throat of the racket ( the AP stands for \" arch power \" ) . Prince squash rackets and Wilson squash rackets have used this type of design before ; these Dynergy AP rackets represent Tecnifibres first foray into this frame shape . <p> All of the new Dynergy AP rackets will come strung with a new brand of Tecnifibre string called DNAMX . I have n\\'t posted about this string yet , but will do soon . <p> Tecnifibre are launching these with a bang : Miguel Angel Rodriguez , the charismatic Colombian , has already started using the Tecnifibre Dynergy AP 125 , which is the lightest of the three . <p> These rackets will replace the previous Tecnifibre Dynergy rackets from a few years ago . Tecnifibre are keeping their other two lines , the Carboflex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mohamed El Shorbagy and approximately 8 million other top pros ) and the Suprem line , which have the traditional head shape . <h> Reviews <p> here \\'s my video review of all three rackets ! Thanks to Tecnifibre for providing these rackets to review . <p> You \\'re welcome , Usman . I may not be able to give you the right answer but I \\'ll try . I \\'m sure Pierre will have something to say on this . The numbers 16 , 17 , and 18 refer to the gauge of the squash string ; lower number implies thicker gauge and the higher number thinner gauge . Squash strings come in only two gauges , I think 17 and 18. 17 is thicker and 18 is thinner . 17 gauge strings diameter ranges from 1.16 mm to 1.25 mm , whereas 18 gauge strings diameter range is 1.06 mm 1.15 mm . ( It means the Tecnifibre Dynergy AP 125 come pre-strung with 17 gauge DNAMX string . ) Thicker gauge provides more durability but less power and thinner gauge provides more power but less durability . So , there \\'s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , in combination with the gauge , the tension at which the rackets are strung . I \\'ve only used stock DNAMX string in my Tecnifibre Dynergy AP 125 , so I cant say which one you should buy . There are other options available but someone else , who has used other strings , can give you a better opinion . Hope this help . <p> Hi everyone , I recently broke my Tecnifibre Carboflex 125S and now searching for a new racket . The problem is that there is no way I can try a whole lot of rackets before I buy a new one . I tried Head Graphene Xenon 135 and Head Graphene XT Cyano 110 . I felt that the 135 version provided more control while the 110 one was more powerful . But I also felt that the Head rackets in general are flexible and vibrate on contact with the ball ( it could be due to my ( faulty ? ) technique but I rarely felt the Carboflex 125S vibrating ) . I \\'m thinking of getting Tecnifibre Dynergy AP 125 but before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other visitors could provide their feedback . Looking at the pictures of Dynergy AP 125 , I \\'ve a feeling that due to its squarer shaft it would tend to vibrate more as compared to Carboflex 125S , which has a rounder shaft . But of course its just my feeling . One of the contributor on this site felt that this racket is chunky , which makes it difficult to dig the ball out of the corners . Anyhow , any guidance in terms of Dynergy 125s comparison with Carboflex 125S would be welcome . Other options I have are Dynergy 117 , Prince Pro Sovereign 650 , and Prince Team Airstick 500 ( but I have n\\'t tried these ) . Any **31;65;TOOLONG would indeed be greatly appreciated . By the way , I \\'m an average club-level player , thin frame , and I play 3-4 times a week . I \\'m not a power hitter . Thanks . <p> Hi Omer , this is a tricky one as I did n\\'t  think the Tecnifibre Dynergy AP 125 had much vibration , but then again I \\'ve used the Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I \\'m not sure if I can answer this too well . <p> Hi Pierre , thanks for your reply . Like I said , it might be because of my inadequate technique that I felt vibrations when playing with Head rackets . Or it could be due to stock strings . But at the same I havent felt much vibration playing with Tecnifibre , Wilson , or Dunlop rackets . By the way , I have played with Wilson Fierce BLX , which I liked very much , Dunlop Aerogel 4D Elite , which did n\\'t  suit my style of play at all as I got tennis elbow playing with it , and Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 S , which is a very nice racket . Anyhow , I decided to go with Tecnifibre Dynergy AP 125 . Why Im ( have ) switched away from Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 S ? Well , I thought a slightly head heavy racket would suit my style of play ( unfortunately , where I play , there are n\\'t  many people who can give me solid advice , so its more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to get this one . It is a nice racket but feels heavier than Carboflex 125 S. I have played with it for 2 days , though I like it as it has improved power in my shots but at the same time it is difficult to volley with this racket . In my opinion , its quite a forgiving racket and sweet spot appears to be larger too . But for anyone who is switching from a lighter , even-balanced racket , it would take some time to get used to this racket . And to be honest , I liked the cosmetics and design of this racket , so I really wanted to get this one : ) . Once again , thanks for your reply . <p> Do n\\'t  bother with the any prince racket under 750 power level . If you do , they have a lot more vibration and less feedback ( generally ) than the ones higher in the range . <p> Also , if you found that the carboflex felt good for you and did not vibrate , then you definitely want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For most people this is the case with racket comfort , but the odd player finds that a very stiff racket ( black knight ion , the graphene xt head cyanogen ) feels more stable and has less vibration . This is down to technique and tightness of grip when hitting . <p> I have used a prince 850 black so and its equivalent for years , previously a carboflex , and am moving back to using tecnifibre again buy going for the dynergy ap 130 . <p> Also , forget weight , its ALL about balance ( unless your looking at a 150+ racket ) . Ive used 110 rackets with the same balance at a 145 and they both feel the same for me . Conversely , I \\'ve used 130s with different balance and they are like chalk and cheese in terms of swing timing . <p> I \\'ve just wrecked my Head ix 120 racket , now looking to pick up a replacement . My other racket is a carboflex 130 and must say although did compromise with carboflex 125 am , very happy with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dynergy AP 125 vs the Dynergy 117 as is there a significant variation . I \\'ve seen the review for both these , but a comparison btwn them would help . <p> Hi Pierre Nice feedback and review.Just wanted to know if there was any difference you felt compared to the last version of Carbonflex 125 s and Dynergy AP 125 ? Great to know your thoughts as a comparison . <p> Thanks Ahsan , I have n\\'t actually played much with the Carboflex 125 S but I borrowed a friends over the weekend for a few minutes and compared it with the Dynergy AP 125 . I would say the Carboflex feels more flexible and the Dynergy more stiff . The Dynergy feels more substantial , with a thicker shaft . <p> With the way Miguel uses this racket it looks versatile and powerful but his own racket skill is also a factor on how the shots work out coming of the racket ! I do feel the AP is going to be a wonderful addition to the tecnifibre technology with the stiff shafts they have . i look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rackets are already available in India . I can pick up the 125 for about USD 110 , the MRP is about USD 150 . The other 2 are 10 to 15% cheaper . I will order a 125 AP later today and hope to post my take on the racket early next week . Amazon.in says that this is the \" most powerful racket \" = Will find out soon enough . <p> Hi I received my Dynergy AP 125 and played with it over 2 days . A very good racket for Power and control . I like it more than the Carboflex 125 . The balance is 0.05 mm more towards the head but feels light , smooth and very quick . A much bigger sweet spot and easy to use . The beauty of this racket is that getting the ball out of the corners / hitting boasts is much easier , you do not need to go hard for the ball . You will need to understand the head angles to use and reasonable racket head speed ( swing ) will get you winners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practice and learn \" what else it can do \" .

My racket started developing small hairline cracks on the inside area of the closed throat . Definitely not due to impact . Really gutted , as I enjoy the racket . Trying to get some response or help in this regard from Salming directly or the local dealer was totally pointless . You will not get any feedback or Customer interaction from Salming at all ! The local dealer does not provide feedback either and just tries to ignore you in hoping you will go away eventually . My advice is to not buy a Salming racket , rather make use of the other reputable brands that actually support their own products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emails to various different mail addresses I could find I got a response and Salming has decided to replace the racket . SO I can not fault them standing by their productit did take a few attempts though ! = <p> I bought an Aero Vectran Forza and after two weeks of play here are my thoughts <p> The good Light , but not feather light ; feels well balanced in your hand , and I was able to hit fairly well with it from day one . Just a comfortable racquet to play with . Quick and easy to maneuver . Some power and control , but you need to be hitting the sweet spot consistently . <p> The bad Small sweet spot , and the string type it came with is not to my liking at all ( feels hard , and was not helped by manufacturer string tension ) . Also , the racquet has an unusual string pattern \" fairly tight second to ninth row , then it opens up really wide in the lower middle to bottom area ( its got a fairly immediate drastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only element of the design I question ; along with the manufacturer strings that is , which I would replace with something a little softer , and at a lower tension ( which might help off-center shots and add power ) . <p> My opinion is that this racquet is for the higher level player . I felt that you needed to keep the ball in the middle of the third to ninth row ( the top third of the racquet face ) or the ball would not do what you wanted . It is not a forgiving racquet . But when the ball was hit in this area of the face , the control was excellent , and the power was there . <p> This wont be a keeper for me , but in the hands of someone who is able to consistently hit the slightly small sweet spot , and likes a light racquet that just feels good in your hand , it most certainly could be . <p> Squash play history Over thirty years playing the game , and currently a local 5.0 level player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince , Technifibre , and Head racquets . <p> From Salming Squashs facebook profile : \" We are excited to announce world no.17 and South African no.1 Steve Coppinger to the Salming team !

Definitely not bulky for a squash shoe . It is quite wide at the ball of the foot which I guess might make it look bulky but in reality this is a pretty light squash shoe . <p> I have had both pairs ( Fastball 1 &amp; 2 ) and by no means is the 2 a bulky shoe . However , the 1 is definitely a more minimal shoe than the 2 . There is noticeably less padding in the forefoot in the 1 , and it fits tighter . I have to pull the laces tighter on the 2 so that my foot does n\\'t  move within the shoe on hard lunges . I do n\\'t  know if there is a weight difference between the two models . If there is , I am not really noticing it . Both pairs are substantially less bulky than the Blast series of which Ive worn the 4/5/7 . <p> Just saw these in a store in Helsinki . They feel like the stripped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing . ( Approx G15-20 cheaper than what the fastball 1 launched at ) .

So , I am wondering if the balance on this Ultalite Stealth would be resemble more to the Spark or the Vibe . Can you answer that question since you tried all of them ? Thank you <p> Hi Karl , I would say the Ultralite is more like the Spark . The Ultralite and the Spark have the same head shape . The Vibe has a slightly larger head , which makes it a little tougher to dig balls out of the deep back corner . The Ultralite and the Spark also have about the same weight ( on my home scale ) . The main difference between them is the Spark has a concave frame and the Ultralite a convex frame . ( The Vibe has a convex frame , so in that respect is similar to the Ultralite . ) There \\'s a bit more info in my Harrow squash rackets roundup video .

I have been absolutely belted with a ball . The ball just flew off the shield , the shield just seemed to absorb the ball . I also got hit hard with a racquet on a follow through and once again I came out of it unscathed and so did the i-MASK . I love the product and would highly recommend them to all players .

The new versions headband is an improvement , the old one was just a sponge like thing ( but you got three of them ) . <p> One benefit that your video did not mention is that ( if ) when you get hit with a racquet or an elbow , the iMask takes the blow and flies off .

The Pro Phantom is a \" replacement \" for the Pro Rebel ( previously the EXO3 Rebel ) . 2 . As noted above , the \" Pro \" models are the largely the same as the \" Team \" models except for the addition of the lighter , stiffer , higher quality TexTreme carbon . This makes them much lighter but also considerably more expensive ! 3 . The TexTreme now wraps around the whole top part of the frame ( from around 10 oclock right over the top and round to around to 2 oclock ) . The previous 2016 TexTreme racquets only had a small patch at 10 oclock and 2 oclock points . 4 . The new Pro Beast is the only racquet in the range to use the Powerbite string pattern and is slightly heavier than its predecessor at 135g unstrung ; the previous ones were 128g ( I should know , I \\'ve had four of them ! ) . 5 . Spec-wise , I do n\\'t  think the other \" new \" racquets have changed a great deal from their earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire range by about 20% . This might just be for me being in the UK and the - being weaker in comparison to the G/$ last year but could also be due to the extra TexTreme used in their construction . <p> So , Looks like the Pro rackets feature Textreme , and the team rackets do not . <p> Other than that , the four in each range are the same spec in terms of weight and power and string pattern ? Looks like the Phantom take the **25;131;TOOLONG head shape , whereas the other three are the Airsick/Warrior/Beast and look like the airsick headship , probably mimic the previous models and weights that these ranges have always followed . <p> The beast definitely has the 14/17 string pattern , whereas the airsick and the warrior have the 16/17 . <p> Nice to see them simplify their range at last , but a shame theyve not gone with putting some speed/03 ports in the other headshape style of racket I always wondered how that would play as my favourites of all time were the speed port black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange to not see a team or rebel among those .

A little heads up before , so you know what i am comparing it to , i had these before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asics rocket ( pro:great for narrow feet , light , low price , good grip and cushioning/ con:weak support ankle hurt after intense sessions ) -adidas court stabil 11 ( pro:great for narrow feet , light , good support/con : needed to buy insole for better cushioning ) -adidas counterblast ( pro:light , good grip and cushioning/con : price , not supportive enough for my ankle ) -adidas adipower stabil 11 ( pro:great for wide feet , great support and cushioning/con : price , heavy-bulky ) -mizuno wave stealth 2 ( pro:great for wide feet , great support and cushioning , good grip/con : price , feels to high from the ground ) And now the fireblast . I have narrow feet so its perfect for me . Someone with wide feet might find it to snug . Great grip and great cushioning , but the best thing that i just love is the \" side wing \" it just gives you the best stability and push off , that i have ever experienced . It is pricey , but being an older model you can find good discounts online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , it feels restrictive and akward . After the break in period it just molds after your feet and becomes supper comfortable . Has a low feeling to it on the court but still has great cushioning . So my final verdict : best shoe i have ever played in ( but i have narrow feet ) . A bit pricey if you do n\\'t  find a discount and needs a break-in period . Asside from this I highly recommend it = Cheers , Zsolt <p> Each of them is great , and distinctive in their own way . Rockets made up in price and affordability what it lacked in cushioning or design . Blades were a little low , but comfortable , maneuverable and great grip . But the best so far are the Blasts . <p> I am due to switch my shoes again . Wondering if the Fireblasts are the next logical progression for me . The first thing that strikes me is the price . At $200 they are by far , in my opinion , the costliest squash shoes in the market . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If not , then what other pair would you recommend from the Asics stable . Perhaps because of the price , I \\'ve not seen many people wear this in the East Coast . The Yellow-Black ones look killer , but seem to be really hard to find , like what Gregoire Marche wears . <p> Any advice from Pierre on any other reader , before I take the rather expensive plunge into this pair . There must be something special for it to be priced so high . I am guessing this is even costlier than a top-end Asics Running Shoe ! <p> Hello .

Most likely , this is the updated version of the Prince EXO3 Rebel , which is used by Nicol David and tons of other women and men . <p> Can anybody write about their experience with the 2016 version ? Is it as heavy as the 2014 one ? Have you weighed it ? 2014 version is about 164g with original grip and strings whereas the 2012 version is about 10g lighter . I know the 2016 is supposed to be a cosmetic makeover but I \\'m still interested . <p> Prince O3 Black &amp; Prince Pro Rebel 950 are both supposed to have the same frame weight of 135g . Nevertheless , when you weigh them on a scale with original grip and strings , the O3 Black is 148g ( something you would expect from a 135g racket ) and the Pro Rebel 950 is 163g ! ! ! 15g more and Prince think nobody will notice ? <p> I \\'ve played with this racket for a year or so and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge although the head-heaviness makes it less easy to wave around if volleying upcourt . I smashed it just before Christmas and ordered two more from Amazon for GBP 90 each that \\'s how much I like it . <p> For the best results from a Prince Pro Rebel 950 , one needs to restring it with a TF X-one string , this noticeably reduces the head weight as this string is lighter and at 1.18 mm , makes it comfortable for rallying . Best stringing results in terms of increased power and control come at 25-26 lbs . \\n@@90398241 @5898241/ <p> I am confused I thought the Silk was head light ?

All 3 of us now regularly finish games with blooded socks with 1cm wounds just below the inside ankles . Skin removed at the same spot .

In fact he won the Qatar Classic in them . Here he is : 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> So i got this shoe like a month ago and thought i would give some feedback . A little heads up before , so you know what i am comparing it to , i had these before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asics rocket ( pro:great for narrow feet , light , low price , good grip and cushioning/ con:weak support ankle hurt after intense sessions ) -adidas court stabil 11 ( pro:great for narrow feet , light , good support/con : needed to buy insole for better cushioning ) -adidas counterblast ( pro:light , good grip and cushioning/con : price , not supportive enough for my ankle ) -adidas adipower stabil 11 ( pro:great for wide feet , great support and cushioning/con : price , heavy-bulky ) -mizuno wave stealth 2 ( pro:great for wide feet , great support and cushioning , good grip/con : price , feels to high from the ground ) And now the fireblast . I have narrow feet so its perfect for me . Someone with wide feet might find it to snug . Great grip and great cushioning , but the best thing that i just love is the \" side wing \" it just gives you the best stability and push off , that i have ever experienced . It is pricey , but being an older model you can find good discounts online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , it feels restrictive and akward . After the break in period it just molds after your feet and becomes supper comfortable . Has a low feeling to it on the court but still has great cushioning . So my final verdict : best shoe i have ever played in ( but i have narrow feet ) . A bit pricey if you do n\\'t  find a discount and needs a break-in period . Asside from this I highly recommend it = Cheers , Zsolt <p> Each of them is great , and distinctive in their own way . Rockets made up in price and affordability what it lacked in cushioning or design . Blades were a little low , but comfortable , maneuverable and great grip . But the best so far are the Blasts . <p> I am due to switch my shoes again . Wondering if the Fireblasts are the next logical progression for me . The first thing that strikes me is the price . At $200 they are by far , in my opinion , the costliest squash shoes in the market . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If not , then what other pair would you recommend from the Asics stable . Perhaps because of the price , I \\'ve not seen many people wear this in the East Coast . The Yellow-Black ones look killer , but seem to be really hard to find , like what Gregoire Marche wears . <p> Any advice from Pierre on any other reader , before I take the rather expensive plunge into this pair . There must be something special for it to be priced so high . I am guessing this is even costlier than a top-end Asics Running Shoe ! <p> Hello .

Most likely , this is the updated version of the Prince EXO3 Rebel , which is used by Nicol David and tons of other women and men . <p> Can anybody write about their experience with the 2016 version ? Is it as heavy as the 2014 one ? Have you weighed it ? 2014 version is about 164g with original grip and strings whereas the 2012 version is about 10g lighter . I know the 2016 is supposed to be a cosmetic makeover but I \\'m still interested . <p> Prince O3 Black &amp; Prince Pro Rebel 950 are both supposed to have the same frame weight of 135g . Nevertheless , when you weigh them on a scale with original grip and strings , the O3 Black is 148g ( something you would expect from a 135g racket ) and the Pro Rebel 950 is 163g ! ! ! 15g more and Prince think nobody will notice ? <p> I \\'ve played with this racket for a year or so and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge although the head-heaviness makes it less easy to wave around if volleying upcourt .

Best stringing results in terms of increased power and control come at 25-26 lbs . \\n@@90398252 @5898252/ <h> Sponsored Links product i \\'d : 34212 222377 @qwx842377 222379 @qwx842379 <p> Marwan has been using the Harrow Silk for years .

Not only that but the boost material naturally rebounds your foot coming back which is amazing . Yes i was a little worried about them sitting higher to the floor but they lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever owned , and i was just fine with quick lateral movements . <p> Have you tried these shoes ? Please leave a review in the comments ! Thanks . 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I changed to the new Stabil Boost coming from the Adipower Stabil 11 and it does feel completely different . The new Boost definitely has more cushion than the old Adipower , feeling slightly bulkier but not in a bad way . It took a few times on the squash court to get used to them , but once I did , I actually prefer them to the old Adipower . Also , no more ankle abrasion issues I had those problems with every pair of the Adipowers I owned . <p> My progression with shoes : <p> Asics Gel Domain 2 I loved those shoes good price for performance/sturdiness . Used them until the Asics Gel Domain 3s came out and the 2s were discontinued the 3s were horrible , the materials were cheap and it just felt crappy compared to the 2s . <p> Adipower Stabil 11 : A huge upgrade from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Asics , I would have never owned the Asics . <p> I bought a pair in black color and I \\'ve been using them for a week already . The design is very cool , I felt them a bit hard at the beginning but It always takes my feet some time to adapt because they are very different from the Adidas Adipower stabil 11 . They feel more elevated in the heel area but the cushion is great and I feel my feet pretty well locked . the materials of the shoe seem excelent quality and the grip to the floor is good . I recommend them . found them in amazon at $80 usd <p> Thanks this helps ! I had a feeling it wouldnt be the same or let \\'s say similarly awesome as the Stabil 11 . I do n\\'t  understand why Adidas would go and bring this to the market considering a lot of pros are fond of the Stabil 11 . This means I need to go look for another model than can compete with the Stabil 11 . Any tips ? <p> I \\'m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive in a few days . I have played the last year in the volley Boost ( volleyball shoe adidas ) and loved them . I am a massive fan of boost cushioning . Have them in all my running shoes . The best thing about the boost is it does n\\'t  compact and compress like normal/older cushioning plastics . It only looses 1% of its original effectiveness . So the upper of my current shoes have worn away before the cushion has . These are going to be lighter than what i am wearing now and I \\'m going to have the added energy return . <p> I presume you are using these for squash . Did they feel bulky or slow compared to your Blades ? Their weight is on the heavy side but so are Asics Blasts and I was fine with those , so perhaps these would be fine . <p> Only negative data point so far is that they \\'ve been out for a while and I am still seeing the pros use the Stabil 11 and Stabil 10.1 on tour . Why are n\\'t  any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I \\'m asking my self the same , they keep using the adipower. i asked for the adipower stabil on amazon and they send me these model i have try them today on the court , they really good , good cousin , light.but ive been using the adipower for many years and i think i like them better . <p> Sorry for the late reply ; I thought I would be notified by mail if I received a reply ( which I do n\\'t  think I received , oh well ! ) . <p> They feel comparable in terms of actual weight , but I certainly do feel they \\'re a keep me a bit \" higher \" on the court compared to the Blades , which I do feel were closer to the floor of the court . <p> That said , I feel more grounded and stable , but the later months of my Gel Blade were with my pair of those shoes being very worn down so its hard to say . <p> I think the bottom line for me is : the difference has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gel Blade , so by and far , I \\'m in good hands insofar as these shoes go . <p> Update : I bought a brand pair of stabil boost for 46G to a handball pro .

Never had that ankle problem many people mention . I have used prince and yonex shoes , I also had the adidas stabil boost shoes but none is as good as these . <p> I write first time here ( but read the site by months ) . Now I use the Adipower Stabil 11 ( white/blue ) and my blue sole is absolutely 100% non-marking . Before that I played in Essence X ( 10 ) and next in Essence 10.1 but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better suited to my feet and more stable . I feel like in tailored shoes . I am very satisfied with the shoes . <p> Guys I play 5-6 days a week and somehow constantly having a challenge getting the right shoe . I have tried Asics Rocket , Wilson , Prince and right now using Dunlope.I planing either to go for Adipower 11 or Gel Blast . I have fairly broad feet and based on what I have read Adidas is narrow from the toe . Any suggestions <p> If you can find a Gel Blast 4 or 5 in your size go for it but if you have wider feet and can afford them I would definitely recommend that you try out the Salmings . The Adipower does fit a little on the narrow size so they might not be ideal . I have slightly narrow feet and these are a snug fit for me . <p> I bought the navy/orange version a couple of weeks ago and having played in them a few times my feedback is mostly positive . To start things off the shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch that Adidas supplies a spare pair of laces too . The shoe was a little stiff to start with but has softened nicely and offers good grip , breathability , stability and cushioning . Fit is normal for length and slightly narrow for width which results in a nice snug fit . As noted before I have suffered a little bit with rubbing underneath the ankle due to the high tabs on these shoes but just made a small adjustment by wearing slightly higher socks and that has helped . <p> Bought those 2 weeks ago in white/blue/silverish , sent them back the day after , I thought I had reasonably wide feet but these shoes clearly made me feel like a hobbit in a pair of Louboutin , God that was painful . So I found and bought a pair of Mizuno Lightning RX ( not in production anymore but the Bolt 4 are the equivalent in todays line up ) and that was perfect . <p> I bought the Adipower Stabil 11 , good cushioning , very good grip but the flap for the last lace hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After 5 minutes I \\'ve decided to wear them without fastening completely . Ive tea Unfortunately after 2 months ( I usually play 3/4 times a week ) the gum rubber toe box of the sole completely detached . Impossible to repair it . Incredible for shoes with that price <p> I \\'ve played on these shoes for about 10-11 hours and I can honestly say Im in love with them ! ! ! <p> The sizing is truetheyre a tighter fit but not in a bad way . No wiggle per se and the construction of these shoes is top notch . A little on the heavy side , but i feel that will help in their durability . Compared to other court shoes ive had ( all asics ) i really love the grip of the sole and the again , the construction just makes for a very durable and sure landing on the court . <p> All in all , I would recommend these shoes to anyone that would want to try them . <p> i got rid of these after spells of what i believed was plantar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adidas , in comparison to asics or salming , are heavier . the padding and support is no where near teh quality of salming products and so ive been exclusive to salming since the switch and i do n\\'t  miss em at all.but that \\'s just my feet these are a nice looking court shoe w/ solid grip . <p> Great shoes Great cushioning and support , better made than the stabil 10 I think : less seams on the toe box will lead to less failure there . <p> HOWEVERThe flap for the last lace hole is noticeably higher than before . As a result , the underside of my ankle bone has essentially had the skin sanded off ! Very unpleasant . High tabs couples with firm build and rough material has been damn painful . <p> Unfortunately they are still pretty much as problematic 2 months on ! Despite use at least 5 or 6 days a week , and even putting them in the washing machine to try soften them up , they are still gouging chunks out of my ankle . <p> Its shame , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether its worth the hassle of applying bandages and padding every time I \\'m not sure ! If they werent so expensive , I \\'d have given up a long time ago ! <p> Interestingly , I noticed during the world champs that a couple of players ( Alan Clyne to name one ) were using the mid range version ( Court Stabil ) which I believe has lower tabs . Similarly , Ramy wears the mid range version fo the previous model , so this is possibly and ongoing problem . <p> Hi Stephen , sorry to hear you \\'re having this trouble ! I am honestly not sure what would be best . I wonder if it would help to get an insert for the shoe , so that your heel is raised up a little bit . I have never tried this myself so I am not sure if it will work or be worth the cost to you . Here are a couple links I found with more info : <p> +1 here .

Although the patterns are different and I have added some extra tension tune ups to my ti 120 pro , but this factory strung XT Cyano 135 is just awesome ! <p> The feeling is different with the new model , i think its the weight distribution and the Technology enhancement made on the previous version ( 2 years of hard work ! ! ! ) : i felt its lighter and you can swing faster with the new model keeping in mind both models carry the same DNA characteristics ! <p> my advise is to try the demo versions of both racquets and you will figure out the difference . <p> Personally i switched to the Cyano 120 XT Model , because its lighter and fit my game * front court attacking player*. also ive tried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of control , the 135 model is power + control , the 110 XT model is pure power . <p> Thanks for your feedback and you are right about the feel of these two rackets . I demoed both 2013 and 2015 model and find 2015 a little more comfortable with almost no vibration . 2013 model felt a bit stiff . <p> Unfortunately i never tried the Cyano 115 , but as mentioned before ive tried the 110 XT its light , pure power &amp; good in cut/slice the ball but definitely not the same feeling as in 120 XT &amp; 135 XT models .. its more likely that these models are weaponized with a self guidance system ! easier to direct the ball with precision . <p> I have used Head Graphene XT Cyano 135 now few months and got to say that this is one of most powerful racket what I have used ! Huge amount of power and generating it is so easy , thanks to the head light balance . But still control is also phenomenal , so I would say this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Perfect power 1.25 ) worked well with the racket , but unfortunately the string broke just the week after playing with it . Strung the racket with Ashaway Supenick ZX and I think it adds even more power but still gives you loads of control hit your dropshots to the nick . <p> The Head Graphene XT 135 is my \" Go To \" racket . Terrific power and control . The ease with which you can generate power is nominal as compared to any other racket I have used . I have a Tecnifibre 125 and a Prince Pro Beast 750 . <p> The strings used are Head Perfect Power 125 and work well with the racket . I would even add that if you are playing and getting tired just switch to this racket ! Its fun and really powerful .

My 120 actually has a little more weight to the head than the 135 . <p> These racquets have been fantastic to me so far , next step is figuring out a good stringing setup . Is anyone aware what the factory stringing tension on these is ? I believe they used the Head Evolution 1.1mm string as stock . <p> Hi I live in South Africa and winter conditions do not favour a slow racket at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control in summer but in winter I have problems with power using a light racket of 120g , tried to restring to lower tension 26psi but it made very little difference . Against slow balls and cold court the racket is dead.I am now trying out heavier rackets 120grams victor and maybe I should try a 135 head xenon but favour a tear drop shape.My game seems to be much better against a fast player and warmer court but struggling with cold courts.Do u have any advice ? perhaps <p> Hi Zak ! I recommend the Prince head heavy models . Pro SP Black 850 or older models of the Rebel ( not the pro 950 ! They messed that one up ) or the original O3 Black ( all are similar rackets at 135g , bp 37,5cm ) . Very powerful but still controllable rackets with great touch .

I play well in the morning after the cold night when the facility is empty . i have quite enough power and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the place is crowded and body heat makes it even warmer . The head heavy racket makes drives too long and drops too heavy . I have a Prince Airstick 550 for those situations . <p> compared to the neon , the xenon xt feels less clunky and more maneuverable. due to its slim body , the xenon allowed me to dig the ball out of back corners more easily compared to the neon . <p> however , xenon xt is not a very forgiving racquet and i would not advocate it for amateur players . as an amateur , i found it more difficult finding the sweet spot compared to the neon graphene . <p> bottom line the xenon xt is a really nice racquet aesthetically and it is definitely unique and feels very balanced to the touch . however , this is not a very forgiving racquet and is suited for the more accomplished players . <p> Pierre can you give us an update ?

Never had that ankle problem many people mention . I have used prince and yonex shoes , I also had the adidas stabil boost shoes but none is as good as these . <p> I write first time here ( but read the site by months ) . Now I use the Adipower Stabil 11 ( white/blue ) and my blue sole is absolutely 100% non-marking . Before that I played in Essence X ( 10 ) and next in Essence 10.1 but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better suited to my feet and more stable . I feel like in tailored shoes . I am very satisfied with the shoes . <p> Guys I play 5-6 days a week and somehow constantly having a challenge getting the right shoe . I have tried Asics Rocket , Wilson , Prince and right now using Dunlope.I planing either to go for Adipower 11 or Gel Blast . I have fairly broad feet and based on what I have read Adidas is narrow from the toe . Any suggestions <p> If you can find a Gel Blast 4 or 5 in your size go for it but if you have wider feet and can afford them I would definitely recommend that you try out the Salmings . The Adipower does fit a little on the narrow size so they might not be ideal . I have slightly narrow feet and these are a snug fit for me . <p> I bought the navy/orange version a couple of weeks ago and having played in them a few times my feedback is mostly positive . To start things off the shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch that Adidas supplies a spare pair of laces too . The shoe was a little stiff to start with but has softened nicely and offers good grip , breathability , stability and cushioning . Fit is normal for length and slightly narrow for width which results in a nice snug fit . As noted before I have suffered a little bit with rubbing underneath the ankle due to the high tabs on these shoes but just made a small adjustment by wearing slightly higher socks and that has helped . <p> Bought those 2 weeks ago in white/blue/silverish , sent them back the day after , I thought I had reasonably wide feet but these shoes clearly made me feel like a hobbit in a pair of Louboutin , God that was painful . So I found and bought a pair of Mizuno Lightning RX ( not in production anymore but the Bolt 4 are the equivalent in todays line up ) and that was perfect . <p> I bought the Adipower Stabil 11 , good cushioning , very good grip but the flap for the last lace hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After 5 minutes I \\'ve decided to wear them without fastening completely . Ive tea Unfortunately after 2 months ( I usually play 3/4 times a week ) the gum rubber toe box of the sole completely detached . Impossible to repair it . Incredible for shoes with that price <p> I \\'ve played on these shoes for about 10-11 hours and I can honestly say Im in love with them ! ! ! <p> The sizing is truetheyre a tighter fit but not in a bad way . No wiggle per se and the construction of these shoes is top notch . A little on the heavy side , but i feel that will help in their durability . Compared to other court shoes ive had ( all asics ) i really love the grip of the sole and the again , the construction just makes for a very durable and sure landing on the court . <p> All in all , I would recommend these shoes to anyone that would want to try them . <p> i got rid of these after spells of what i believed was plantar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adidas , in comparison to asics or salming , are heavier . the padding and support is no where near teh quality of salming products and so ive been exclusive to salming since the switch and i do n\\'t  miss em at all.but that \\'s just my feet these are a nice looking court shoe w/ solid grip . <p> Great shoes Great cushioning and support , better made than the stabil 10 I think : less seams on the toe box will lead to less failure there . <p> HOWEVERThe flap for the last lace hole is noticeably higher than before . As a result , the underside of my ankle bone has essentially had the skin sanded off ! Very unpleasant . High tabs couples with firm build and rough material has been damn painful . <p> Unfortunately they are still pretty much as problematic 2 months on ! Despite use at least 5 or 6 days a week , and even putting them in the washing machine to try soften them up , they are still gouging chunks out of my ankle . <p> Its shame , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether its worth the hassle of applying bandages and padding every time I \\'m not sure ! If they werent so expensive , I \\'d have given up a long time ago ! <p> Interestingly , I noticed during the world champs that a couple of players ( Alan Clyne to name one ) were using the mid range version ( Court Stabil ) which I believe has lower tabs . Similarly , Ramy wears the mid range version fo the previous model , so this is possibly and ongoing problem . <p> Hi Stephen , sorry to hear you \\'re having this trouble ! I am honestly not sure what would be best . I wonder if it would help to get an insert for the shoe , so that your heel is raised up a little bit . I have never tried this myself so I am not sure if it will work or be worth the cost to you . Here are a couple links I found with more info : <p> +1 here .

Hell , even the color schemes are pretty similar the Elite has a splash of green , the Ultimate a splash of yellow . <p> So , what \\'s the difference then ? It comes down to the string pattern . The string bed on the Elite is more open 14 mains and 18 crosses . The string bed on the Ultimate is more dense 16 mains and 19 crosses .

My thoughts are that its a bit too head light for me , and feels a bit unstable and lacks plow through .

Anyone know if they are due to bring out a 2016 or 2017 model anytime soon ? Would hate to dump --- into one if the new one cones out a month later . <p> Just played with it for the first time and it is a great racket . Various places say its head light , but I do n\\'t  find that . has great control and power , and a really crisp slice/cut. may adopt it as my daily driver until the new rackets come down in price after a few months . <p> I have been playing with this a few months switching over from Dunlop tour cx 2013 . This is significantly better , with the head light balance giving me better control over my volleys and touch shots . Power is adequate as well . Extremely good control for hitting rails along the side wall . I am playing with technifibre 305 1.2 gauge strung at 26lbs , and the feel and control is spot on . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . I loved my last racket , a Head Xenon 135 graphene , because of its enormus control , but sometimes you need an extra power in some hits and the Elite covers this need properly . The bumper zone is so thin , it gives you the opportunity of reach some difficult balls . I-m so happy with the racket . <p> Bought one 4 months ago , couple of issues , it vibrates when you hit the ball on the sweet spot , which is n\\'t exactly rewarding , but at least I understand why it came with an anti vibration mini ball that comes off all the time but its ok since it makes you look like a gigantic dork when its on . Also the factory string ( Dunlop Silk black for mine ) is quite stiff and could use a bit less tension , I \\'m not a fan to say the least , but I guess its a trend now , new players like rackets so stiff it feels like you \\'re hitting the ball with Moses stone tablets . <p> Despite those 2 flaws the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrations were just too much for me , so I bought a set of 305 1,20 hoping it will get better . But as a back up I also bought the carboflex 125S and I think I wo n\\'t bother with the Dunlop when I receive it . <p> I \\'ve recently played with this racquet for a few weeks and I was quite disappointed in its maneuverability and power compared to my head graphene/anion2 racquet . Its supposed to be head light but it feels head heavy after putting the strings on . The frame vibrates uncomfortably with every hit . <p> However , I have n\\'t been able to readjust from playing a tear shaped racquet to the traditional shaped . Both shapes have different sweet spots . I guess that affects my shots . <p> My squash season ends on 4 December , so I \\'m gon na try persist and keep going with this racquet and see how I go . Otherwise , I might have to return to my head anion2 ! <p> After playing this racquet for 3 months now , I feel this racquet provides me great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacks on the power side but surely with different strings or lower tension it may get there . I bought 2 more for back ups ! <p> My friend used the last 3 models of the elite and he mentioned the weight has damaged the tissue in the muscles in his forearm and he s recently switched to the carboflex 125 which he complements as a much better racquet for power and control <p> I was play with the Head Graphene 135 . Quite a powerful racquet . Unfortunately I had a small crack and it got bigger as I was hitting more power shots . Its quite expensive and I was n\\'t willing to buy another one , hence my search for an economically cheaper but high end model . <p> Thanks for your feedback on the power ! Its a good rating system . I suppose for future models you could implement a review rating system in different categories then have an overall score . \\n@@90398290 @5898290/ <p> This is similar in head shape to the Dunlop Force Evolution 120 , which is also new for 2015 and of course is supposed to be 10 grams lighter . I weighed both rackets ( strung ) , and the 130 was only two grams heavier than the 120 , though this is within the normal tolerance of +/- 5 grams . <p> This Force 130 is supposed to be an even balance , and the Force 120 is supposed to be head-light . That matched up with how the rackets felt in my hand . <p> Dunlop is promoting the Force 130 as Alison Waterss racket , and the Force 120 as Nick Matthews . Which is interesting , because last year it was reversed Nick was using the Biomimetic 130 , and Alison was using the Biomimetic 120 . Anyway , the pros are picky about their weights , and probably have them customized to their liking , so this is really about the marketing . <p> Previously Dunlop gave the Biomimetic 120 a pink color i.e. subtly positioning it the \" girl racket \" but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart .

I first saw these when PDH Sports posted some photos of the Salming Viper range on their Instagram account a while back , and they \\'re now available for purchase . <p> I \\'ve found these to be amazing shoes after two weeks of play three times a week . Not much to break in-slightly stiff , high comfort level and premium control on court surfaces ( good looking too ) . I do n\\'t  think anyone has mentioned the bonus of the suction-cup action at the rear part of the sole on the court its a unique sensation hopefully with functional benefits . If I were to change anything to the design , it would be to add more padding at the ankle area ( do n\\'t  get me wrong , its better than most ) . Truth be told , I became so accustom to the Prince NFS IIs that I miss it . Regarding the fit , it is true to size if you are using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11.5 US / 29.5 cm and they are spot on . All manufactures use their own templates ( or \" last \" ) to pattern the shoes shape , so its no surprise when it comes to differences between them . Performance and comfort wise , I think you would be hard pressed to find a better shoe . Durability ? I \\'ll let you know in few months . Brilliant shoe otherwise . <p> I have this shoes for 2 months now . First of all I have to say that they fit bigger than Asics . My previous pair of Asics Domain 2 were a size 12.5 and these Salming are 12s and I probably could wear a pair of 11.5s They as comfortable as the Asics , usually Asics are more comfortable than other brands like Hi Tec but Salming can match up with Asics . About durability , I had some concerns about their durability since I heard some players complaining about this . So far they are holding up . Just a little wear and tear in the insoles and the outer right side its getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glue will fix it . Overall they are great shoes the only CON I can find is their price $190CAD per a pair of shoes seems excessive . If money is not a concern for you then I would recommend these shoes if you are looking for something cheaper go for the Asics Domain 2 ( DO NT BUY THE DOMAIN 3 , THEY ARE TERRIBLE ! ! ! ) . Cheers , <p> Picked a pair of these up as replacements for my asics jel blast 4s . While the shoes perform fantastically they are NOT DURABLE . I drag the upper inner portion of the shoes on deep lunges , and after TWO WEEKS of having these shoes I wore a hole almost completely through the shoe . As a comparison , my pair of jel blast 4s lasted a year and a half . <p> I \\'ve had the vipers since they came out . I was looking for a lightweight shoe so tried these . The fit is really secure with tons of good old fashioned grip . The forefoot does have a minimal padding but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Whilst a few people have voiced concerns about durability mine are lasting extremely well and I play around three times a week so they \\'ve had a decent amount of play and still going strong . The best court shoes Ive tried by far . <p> I bought the Salming Viper now , and i really like how light they are . The mesh also provides good ventilation and keeps your feet cool . But they already show a lot of wear . I don-t think they-ll hold as long as my Hi-Tec shoes did . They are also quite stiff , and give my Achilles tendon some stress I have not experienced from other shoes before . Will get used to hopefully.n++ <p> Thank you : d . Had Mizuno wave stealth IIs before , and while they are really good , it turned out its not for me . They are to \" high off \" from the ground and I just do n\\'t  find the feeling good for my personal style . What i have found about the Viper that it has no special cushioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just wondered how they feel ( for example is the front cushioning at least on the level of a low level asics shoe like the Rocket 6/7 ? ) Sorry for pestering with questions , but I do n\\'t  want to buy another shoe that will turn out to be not right for me , especially considering the price of the Viper . I \\'m looking for a shoe that has good grip , that locks down your foot inside and a low feeling with some cushioning . Up until now i have considered the Asics Gel blade 4 , Nike kobe 9 and this . If anyone has played in one of these please give me some feedback . Would appreciate it . Thanks ! <p> Drop 7mm The heel to toe drop of 7- sets up a natural posture , allowing a correct lean throughout the stride . <p> LMS+ Fast lateral stops expose the foot to the risk to roll over outwards , causing injuries . LMS+ ( Lateral Movement Stabilizer Plus ) is a unique design with a positive angle of 11- that prevents the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first layer of mesh material adds comfort , while the middle stabilizes lateral movements and reduces pressure on the foot . The exterior thin net mesh encapsulates and wraps up the front in a neat fashion , adding durability to the shoe . <p> Great term , \" Locks down your foot \" . Sadly , I bought my size in the new Viper they do run a little large . This may be due to the style/design they used in the forefoot area . IMHO that space is too big , and it does not lock down on your foot with the resulting effect of sliding around a bit in the shoe . Or they just run large . I may have to try a 1/2 size smaller . \\n@@90398294 @5898294/ <p> The DNAMX string is going to be replacing the 305+ in Tecnifibres lineup . <p> David Hickson sent in this photo of two Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 S squash rackets . The top one is newer and you can see they are printing DNAMX on the frame now , instead of 305+ like they used to . <p> Photo via David Hickson <p> I do n\\'t  know if DNAMX and 305+- are made differently , but from a branding standpoint its a great move . Reason being , 305+ was a confusing name , seeing as Tecnifibre also has- 305- Green , a totally different string . <h> Spotted <h> Reviews <p> I \\'ve played quite a few matches with the Tecnifibre Dynergy AP 125 , which comes strung with the DNAMX . I thought the racket had a nice combination of power and feel . <p> In all honesty , its very difficult for me to separate out the feel of the strings from the feel of the overall racket . My plan is to restring one of my other rackets with the DNAMX and see if I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this page ! <p> If you have tried this string and have a view on it , please leave a comment below . Thanks 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I \\'m currently using the DNAMX string in the 18 gauge 1.15mm . I previously used the 305 1.20mm , then switched to the 305 1.10mm , and liked the extra feel and cut in the thinner gauge , however had some premature string breakage , likely due to mishits . This happened on 3 string jobs , so I \\'m now trying the DNAMX at 1.15mm , which I hope is a good compromise between the 305s 17 and 18 gauges , in terms of durability and feel . The feel is pretty good , and very comparable to the 305 . Power feels a tad more than the 305 . As for durability , its only been a few weeks , but so far so good ! <p> I \\'ve also tried the 305+ , which felt more stiffer than the 305 , and I can say the DNAMX is a different string , closer to the 305 in terms of feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison to the 305+ which i have on my 125s , i really do n\\'t  like the stiff feeling of them , power WAS there but has now faded thinking of cutting them out and replacing them but i do n\\'t  know what with ? <p> but i also like these dnamx the best of all of the tec strings . good control and havent had any issues like breakage as some others on here have mentioned . getting a lot good lob and deep shots on these with better efficiency <p> definitely will buy again and keep on the Eye racket. keeping the ZX on my princes <p> I am surprised there are no reviews yet of this string . Once I learned about this string from the Pro Warrior review made by PDH , I started looking for places to buy one , but there werent any . <p> After a few weeks I found it available on PDH sports and I bought two sets of 1.20mm thickness . <p> I installed one on my ProWarrior 600 racket @ 11.3 kgs tension , and I have another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give more power ) . Playing with both rackets back to back , the DNAMX has way more power , and very good control , at least as good as the 305 green . Its power really shows when returning slow balls , even at the back of the court . A simple wrist flick returns the ball to the front wall with ease . This also makes me return boast shots with confidence . <p> For full power shots , I think I am limited by the racket . I have a 2012 EXO3 Rebel with 305+ strings , and it can produce higher power shots . But its heavy , and I like the ProWarrior more . <p> All in all , this is the best string I have ever used ( compared to 305 and 305+ ) . Once I break the 305 green , I will try the X-one @ 11.3 kgs . I am anxious to compare its power &amp; control to the DNAMX on the same racket . <p> I \\'ve had 2 sets of dnamx snap on me now , within a month of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying anymore . Seems its quite weak when the ball is hit hard to the side of the sweet spot . Some red ashaway string I have on another racket ( not sure type ) seems to put up with the same torment so might keep to that . <p> Do you string on an electronic machine ? My best advise ( from experience ) on using PU based string , is to set your machine to lock-out tension , and NOT apply constant tension . <p> If you do not have a pre-stretch function , just up your machine by 1lb , and keep it on lock-out . If you set it to 27 , and lock out , you will not pull out the elasticity of the string and it resist of-centre string breakages a lot more . <p> Correction , now its 3 sets that have snapped within a couple of months , while the ashaway powenick 18 on my carboflex is fine . Def not buying again . Will try the biphase next as the guys at my local club all seem to use it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club I play at started offering the Eye strings like 6 months ago and I have to say I really like them . They give very nice cut on the ball , good power and durability is also good . I tried the 305+ , but they kept breaking near the beam if I miss hit a shot . This has not happened with the Eye string so far . I only break them when they wear out in the middle . I will try their green Eye version as well and see if I can feel any difference . <p> Heard through the grape vine there were a lot of complaints that the 305+ was breaking prematurely so they had to do something . It broke prematurely on me and several players at my club . Heard Dnamx has been used by several of the pros with great success so here it comes . My take on the string , 305+ was touted as 305 with more power with everything you like about 305 and no it never was , it was much harder stiffer and not the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like 305 for rails , control , touch and feel but need just a little more power Dnamx could be your string . If you are using a teardrop headed racquet with 305 but want to go back to a closed throat for its control , feel and touch the Dnamx should allow you the opportunity . If you find that in a closed throat racquet 305 just does n\\'t  allow you to keep your strokes effortless and you have to truly make perfect strong full strokes to get the ball to the back of the court the Dnamx should help . With the Dnamx in teardrops you up the power even more in closed throat in my case it gives the racquet new life and allows you to drive easier to the back of the court . Great touch , great rails with control and feel . If you like 305 you will like Dnamx better . It allows you to be in more control . Enjoy the game ! <p> people skip 305+ and opt for 305 green which has the highest share in strings market followed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flourish 305+ sales they need to give it another name ( few tweaks too ) and associate it with world #1 Mohammed alshorbagy . <p> Just bought some of the new Tecnifibre Dnamx 18g and 17g and strung the 18g up in a Harrow Vibe . Really nice if you like soft strings . The closest to gut yet with better consistency . About to string up an Eye control 120 with it strings nicely also not much coil memory . I have tried a lot of different strings and I seem to always go back to 305 , so far the Dnamx has the nice consistency of the 305 for great rails , softer feel , more power and about the same bite and spin availability . At low tensions , like the 305 it springs back to it \\'s starting position each time , you can hear the strings moving around when you cut the ball but they spring right back in place . Nice string . Enjoy the game ! <p> I would love to hear what you thought about the Dnamx in the V Lite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 305 18 in my CF125s and V Lite 120 Controls . I am considering adding Ultranick 18 into the mix . Have you hit with the UN18 ? How would that compare to the Dnamx and the 305 ? I have been playing with the 305 18 for quite a while and was surprised how much I liked the Dnamx that came strung in the CF125Surprisingly soft . <p> My AP 125 came with this , and after only a few weeks has snapped unfortunately ( about 9 or so games ) . Seemed to snap in one of the top corners , but not sure if it was a genuine string issue or i clipped the ball wrong on power shot . I \\'ve bought another set of the same as i did like the way the whole racket played . Just hope it is n\\'t a recurring issue . \\n@@90398296 @5898296/ <h> Tecnifibre Suprem SB Squash Rackets <p> The Tecnifibre Suprem SB squash rackets are new for 2017 / 2018 . These are updated versions of the long-running Tecnifibre Suprem models , which are Tecnifibres \" traditional head shape \" rackets with a bridge across the throat . There are four rackets in this release : <p> Some observations : 1 . Head size : the 125 is 470cm2 , whilst the 130 is 500cm2 this is the reverse of the recent models where the 130 was smaller than the 125. 2 . Weight : on my digital scale , both weighed the same , coming in at 160g strung and gripped . 3 . Balance : the 130 was more head-heavy whilst the 125 felt more even 4 . Power/Control : the 130 was more powerful , the 125 more control 5 . Feel : Lots ! ! ! ! <p> I think both are decent rackets ; unfortunately I never had the chance to play with the recent models so ca n\\'t make any comparison . I do n\\'t  think the angled bridge at the bottom of the racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with factory strings ( which I feel was strung way too high ) , which made every ball I hit felt plank-ish . <p> Kudos to TF for trying to introduce some innovation to their frames it will certainly intrigue some players to try them out !

I wanted to get an identical racquet as a back up but buying another graphene is too much when anion2 is half price . Thank you ! <p> Hi David , I have n\\'t tried these rackets against each other so I cant say for 100% sure , but having got that caveat out of the way , my bet is these rackets are very similar and you would be happy using some of the older models as backups . You could even check out the two-versions-ago racket , the Head 135 CT , and save even a few more bucks . If you do try the older models out , please do let us know how it worked out ! Thanks <p> I bought the anion2 and restrung this and graphene with the tecnifibre biphase 1.18 at 27lbs . The anion2 makes a really good backup racquet with great control and decent power . Though I think anion2 has a slightly heavier head which makes volleying a bit different . Or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without compromising power . I felt the graphene was able to cut air faster than anion2 . <p> Overall I \\'m happy with the purchase . At least I know I \\'ll always have a backup racquet should anything happen . <p> Hey Seb , its often the case with the top pros , in squash as much as in tennis , that they use custom setups or older rackets repainted to market newer models . Other than Gaultier , Shabana over the years almost always was using the old ICE racket he s using now , but painted to look like the Ultimate . You \\'ll see the bulge in the top of the grip , and the fact that the Ultimate has 16+19 strings but Shabanas racket is 14+18 . <p> Other than those two , Nicks was the same racket as marketed , but had some customizations he did n\\'t  go into detail about . Ramys Dunlops were almost always custom when I asked him about it , and he also admitted to playing with Prince while he was with Head ( he said that was admittedly not a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that a lot of Pros ( exception being younger ones ) do n\\'t  play with the actual rackets they are paid to endorse .

He painted his Prince rackets and the strings to show HEAD logos . <p> I am looking for a evenly balanced or head-light racket in the 130-135 gm weight range , so I will try out the Aerogel 4D Elite and the Harrow Vapor and see how they feel .

Often , and especially in the early days of the game , squash was played in \" upper-crust \" locations from renowned private schools and colleges to exclusive private mens clubs . So in some ways , its no surprise that the game was played on that world-famous ship . <p> Squash was first played in the 1860s by boys at the Harrow School in England . The boys took a small rubber ball something that we take for granted today but was then only just becoming available and , using racquets , hit the ball off the walls of their school courtyards and alleys . Squash was typically played by underclassmen who did n\\'t  yet have the seniority or skills to play Racquets , the preferred game at the time . <p> Squash spread to the US in 1884 , when St. Pauls , a private boarding school in New Hampshire , built four open-air squash courts . The game also took hold at Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it spread to private mens clubs in Boston , Philadelphia and New York . Gradually , the game spread southward and westward in the US , and began to catch on with a wider audience . <p> By the 1950s , squash had spread throughout the world . The most dramatic example of this worldwide growth was the arrival of Hashim Khan on the international squash scene . Born in a small village in Pakistan , Hashim had an informal job as a ballboy at the courts of a local British Officers Club . He honed his game , eventually landing a job as the local squash pro . In 1951 , Pakistan sent Hashim to play in the British Open , the most prestigious tournament in the world at that time . He crushed the competition , winning the tournament with ease . <p> The game has had many twists and turns , not to mention colorful characters , over the years . If you \\'re interested in reading more about the history of squash , I recommend James Zugs- Squash : A History of the Game ( affiliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to extinction a few times before eventually thriving . <p> The book focuses on the early history of the game in England , and then moves onto the development of the game in North America . If you \\'re looking for more in-depth coverage of squash in other countries , this might not be the best book for you . Of course there \\'s much discussion of squash players from outside the U.S. , since squash is a global game and many of the great players to play in North America were born overseas . And any squash player will appreciate the stories about the origins of the game . \\n@@90398300 @5898300/ <p> Ive played squash for approx. 20 years , stopped playing for 5 and recently came back to squash this year . In my years out , I did triathlons , where calf guards and compression socks are the norm . I used them but the triathlon world is all about copying the pros ! It now appears that they are making inroads into the squash world . <p> My verdict is that any compression gear is useful , but I think it is more of a placebo effect ! When playing squash , I wear a compression t-shirt and shorts , under my visible t-shirt and shorts . I have n\\'t ventured onto court in compression socks / guards , probably because they would be really visible and I do n\\'t  need the ribbing ! <p> Triathlon brands for compression gear are Compressport and CEP .

However , once they ushered in ticketed guests , to their back wall seats , the general admission guests had to return to the general admission area . The usher said that they were allowing people to sit in the premium seats so that it would look good for TV . Had I known this , I would have just paid general admission . For the rest of the tournament however , considering it is the finals and semi-finals falling on a weekend , my guess is that there will not be as many open and free back wall seats available , since there will likely be more squashfans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and final .

They well might be , but nobody would know , because they \\'re just the ball everybody uses . <p> Besides Dunlop , other brands include Black Knight , Eye , Head , Karakal , Prince , Tecnifibre , and Victor . Now , I have used some of these other brands before . Honestly , I cant really tell the difference between Dunlop balls and these other brands . I doubt I could tell them apart in a blind test . Can you even do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t  matter my point is Dunlop is the boss . <h> Doubles Squash Balls <p> Yeah , its just Dunlop runnin shit all over again . These are the official ball of the SDA Pro Tour , which is the pro doubles tour in North America . <h> Singles Hardballs <p> Because America is so special , we invented our own version of squash with a different-sized court and a harder ball . We named this sportsquash . And its what a lot of us old guys used to play exclusively . It was fun , and though most people have switched over to softball squash , there are still a few hardball squash enthusiasts around . They use the fuchsia Dunlop elite singles hardball . <h> Kids squash balls <p> Yay , a category not dominated by Dunlop ! These are big , squishy orange kids squash balls . Theyre spongy , large , and really easy to hit . Unlike regular squash balls , these do n\\'t  need to be warmed up . And here \\'s the thing about these that I find most cool you can hit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dunlop dyd balls take time to warm up during winter . So if its winter and your court token allows you to play for 40 min only in London municipality squash courts for example , then go for dyd Wilson or tecnifibre balls . If court walls are covered with snow from the outside then there \\'s no way you can warm up the ball by hitting it into this frozen wall if i might say . So put the ball in hot water or bring a small flask full of hot water and dip the ball in for few seconds . <p> Imo since aproxx. 1-1,5 years the dunlop yellow double does not bounce as they used to do in earlier years . In addition the durability is very poor currently . 2 hours playing hard and the ball is dead . Way better are Prince , Karakal , Oliver and Victor . And yes , in Germany Victor ist the official ball . It bounces better than Dunlop &gt; more fun , especially at not so warm conditions . <p> I have recently switched to double yellows from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through 12 piece boxes of Dunlops and felt they took temperatur badly and became dull quickly . While with the Dunlops my mates and I more and more frequently had to sort out balls that had lost all their bounce , the Victors still play decently even when they have been tortured long enough to have lost all paint marking the two little dots . So while the Victors are slightly more expensive than the Dunlops I feel they offer a better value in the long run . <p> Totally agree with Jan here . I recently bought a few Dunlop double yellow dots and they are dull as a tomato ( not sure what the right proverb is = ) . Having never tried Victor , Karakal also is a much better option . <p> Hi Squash fans . According to this article below 90% of squash players should be using single yellow dot balls . I play at a good level in my county leagues and have always played with the double yellow dot . <p> The Dunlop white ball that is used on the dark glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the pros , when playing on SquashTV are playing with the slightly bouncier ball ? If anyone has knowledge of this , I \\'d love to know . <p> Thanks , Nick ! I \\'d seen the first thread , but not the second . So , buried deep in the middle , was a response from World Squash stating the white ball ( with its single yellow dot ) is equivalent to the double dot black Dunlop . <p> BTW , I \\'m in agreement that most club players would have a better experience using the single yellow dot ball . Its a tough sell , though . <p> I bought three packs of Dunlop double spot and single spot last autumn . Two of the single spots were less bouncy than a double spot normally is so no use at all on cold courts . One of the double spots would n\\'t bounce either .

I wanted to get an identical racquet as a back up but buying another graphene is too much when anion2 is half price . Thank you ! <p> Hi David , I have n\\'t tried these rackets against each other so I cant say for 100% sure , but having got that caveat out of the way , my bet is these rackets are very similar and you would be happy using some of the older models as backups . You could even check out the two-versions-ago racket , the Head 135 CT , and save even a few more bucks . If you do try the older models out , please do let us know how it worked out ! Thanks <p> I bought the anion2 and restrung this and graphene with the tecnifibre biphase 1.18 at 27lbs . The anion2 makes a really good backup racquet with great control and decent power . Though I think anion2 has a slightly heavier head which makes volleying a bit different . Or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without compromising power . I felt the graphene was able to cut air faster than anion2 . <p> Overall I \\'m happy with the purchase . At least I know I \\'ll always have a backup racquet should anything happen . <p> Hey Seb , its often the case with the top pros , in squash as much as in tennis , that they use custom setups or older rackets repainted to market newer models . Other than Gaultier , Shabana over the years almost always was using the old ICE racket he s using now , but painted to look like the Ultimate . You \\'ll see the bulge in the top of the grip , and the fact that the Ultimate has 16+19 strings but Shabanas racket is 14+18 . <p> Other than those two , Nicks was the same racket as marketed , but had some customizations he did n\\'t  go into detail about . Ramys Dunlops were almost always custom when I asked him about it , and he also admitted to playing with Prince while he was with Head ( he said that was admittedly not a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that a lot of Pros ( exception being younger ones ) do n\\'t  play with the actual rackets they are paid to endorse .

Often , and especially in the early days of the game , squash was played in \" upper-crust \" locations from renowned private schools and colleges to exclusive private mens clubs . So in some ways , its no surprise that the game was played on that world-famous ship . <p> Squash was first played in the 1860s by boys at the Harrow School in England . The boys took a small rubber ball something that we take for granted today but was then only just becoming available and , using racquets , hit the ball off the walls of their school courtyards and alleys . Squash was typically played by underclassmen who did n\\'t  yet have the seniority or skills to play Racquets , the preferred game at the time . <p> Squash spread to the US in 1884 , when St. Pauls , a private boarding school in New Hampshire , built four open-air squash courts . The game also took hold at Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it spread to private mens clubs in Boston , Philadelphia and New York . Gradually , the game spread southward and westward in the US , and began to catch on with a wider audience . <p> By the 1950s , squash had spread throughout the world . The most dramatic example of this worldwide growth was the arrival of Hashim Khan on the international squash scene . Born in a small village in Pakistan , Hashim had an informal job as a ballboy at the courts of a local British Officers Club . He honed his game , eventually landing a job as the local squash pro . In 1951 , Pakistan sent Hashim to play in the British Open , the most prestigious tournament in the world at that time . He crushed the competition , winning the tournament with ease . <p> The game has had many twists and turns , not to mention colorful characters , over the years . If you \\'re interested in reading more about the history of squash , I recommend James Zugs- Squash : A History of the Game ( affiliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to extinction a few times before eventually thriving . <p> The book focuses on the early history of the game in England , and then moves onto the development of the game in North America . If you \\'re looking for more in-depth coverage of squash in other countries , this might not be the best book for you . Of course there \\'s much discussion of squash players from outside the U.S. , since squash is a global game and many of the great players to play in North America were born overseas . And any squash player will appreciate the stories about the origins of the game . \\n@@90398315 @5898315/ <p> Ive played squash for approx. 20 years , stopped playing for 5 and recently came back to squash this year . In my years out , I did triathlons , where calf guards and compression socks are the norm . I used them but the triathlon world is all about copying the pros ! It now appears that they are making inroads into the squash world . <p> My verdict is that any compression gear is useful , but I think it is more of a placebo effect ! When playing squash , I wear a compression t-shirt and shorts , under my visible t-shirt and shorts . I have n\\'t ventured onto court in compression socks / guards , probably because they would be really visible and I do n\\'t  need the ribbing ! <p> Triathlon brands for compression gear are Compressport and CEP .

They \\'re just perfect , okay ? <h> Best Squash Balls <p> In the world of squash balls , the 600-pound gorilla is Dunlop squash balls Theyre the official balls of just about everything . Its not that they \\'re necessarily the BEST squash ball out there . They well might be , but nobody would know , because they \\'re just the ball everybody uses . <p> Besides Dunlop , other brands include Black Knight , Eye , Head , Karakal , Prince , Tecnifibre , and Victor .

Can you even do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t  matter my point is Dunlop is the boss . <h> Doubles Squash Balls <p> Yeah , its just Dunlop runnin shit all over again . These are the official ball of the SDA Pro Tour , which is the pro doubles tour in North America . <h> Singles Hardballs <p> Because America is so special , we invented our own version of squash with a different-sized court and a harder ball . We named this sportsquash . And its what a lot of us old guys used to play exclusively . It was fun , and though most people have switched over to softball squash , there are still a few hardball squash enthusiasts around . They use the fuchsia Dunlop elite singles hardball . <h> Kids squash balls <p> Yay , a category not dominated by Dunlop ! These are big , squishy orange kids squash balls . Theyre spongy , large , and really easy to hit . Unlike regular squash balls , these do n\\'t  need to be warmed up . And here \\'s the thing about these that I find most cool you can hit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dunlop dyd balls take time to warm up during winter . So if its winter and your court token allows you to play for 40 min only in London municipality squash courts for example , then go for dyd Wilson or tecnifibre balls . If court walls are covered with snow from the outside then there \\'s no way you can warm up the ball by hitting it into this frozen wall if i might say . So put the ball in hot water or bring a small flask full of hot water and dip the ball in for few seconds . <p> Imo since aproxx. 1-1,5 years the dunlop yellow double does not bounce as they used to do in earlier years . In addition the durability is very poor currently . 2 hours playing hard and the ball is dead . Way better are Prince , Karakal , Oliver and Victor . And yes , in Germany Victor ist the official ball . It bounces better than Dunlop &gt; more fun , especially at not so warm conditions . <p> I have recently switched to double yellows from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through 12 piece boxes of Dunlops and felt they took temperatur badly and became dull quickly . While with the Dunlops my mates and I more and more frequently had to sort out balls that had lost all their bounce , the Victors still play decently even when they have been tortured long enough to have lost all paint marking the two little dots . So while the Victors are slightly more expensive than the Dunlops I feel they offer a better value in the long run . <p> Totally agree with Jan here . I recently bought a few Dunlop double yellow dots and they are dull as a tomato ( not sure what the right proverb is = ) . Having never tried Victor , Karakal also is a much better option . <p> Hi Squash fans . According to this article below 90% of squash players should be using single yellow dot balls .

One thing I forgot to mention in the video : this racket has a listed weight of 115 grams unstrung , but it feels heavier than that , and on my scale it came in at 155 grams strung .

I will try to borrow a friends Apex Infinity and compare it to the Cyano in the coming days . <p> I was n\\'t able to hit with the Apex because the strings were broken , but here are a few notes . The frames are quite similarly-shaped . I noticed the Apex has more of the weight in the head , which may be why I thought it was heavier . This should make it a bit slower and steadier through the air . The Apex also has the fan stringing pattern versus a traditional pattern on the Cyano , so I think the Apex will feel a little more powerful . \\n@@90398323 @5898323/ <h> Prince Squash Shoes Roundup <p> Prince squash shoes have been around for ages .

The sweet spot was huuuuge , which was cool . It felt very powerful you can really whack the ball with it . My biggest problem with this racket is it felt too far along on the power spectrum , at the cost of control . This racket was too erratic for me . I had trouble getting my drives to stick to the wall and generally could n\\'t move the ball around very precisely . <p> Heres Paul \" Flexarm \" Hargraves review . He says this is in Tecnifibres power range of rackets . <p> Just bought it and played once . Its immediately obvious that it has a fantastic frame ( for my play ) , balanced , just a tiny bit flexy , head light , you can miss a volley and hit the ball with a second attempt very easily . Only problem is that its not very precise , it might be the strings I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grip than other rackets . I will try with an ashaway string soon <p> I just picked one up and found it slightly head heavy compared to my Carboflex 125 racquets . Actual weight is also heavier 5 lbs 3 oz for the 117 , 5 lbs 1 oz for the first 125 Carboflex with 305+ 1.10 string and 5 lbs 2 oz 125 Carboflex with RAB Sensorfibre 1.25 string in it . The Carboflex 125 is or feels very balanced , light and maneuverable and the 117 a bigger feel it hits hard and has a very concentrated sweet spot where the 125 has a larger sweet spot . The 117 is more focused and if you hit the ball correctly it is deadly . The 125 is more forgiving but not as precise if that makes sense . So I find when I am on the 117 is great if I am not having that full on focused match the 125 helps me stay in the match . I have used Prince , Dunlops and some Head racquets and even restrung with Tecnifibre string but Tecnifibre racquets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to lighten the head up a bit put Tecnifibre 305 18 gauge ( black or green ) in your racket . The rackets come pre-strung from the factory with 17 gauge and putting the 18 gauge will definitely lighten the head . That \\'s what I do as soon as I get a new racket and its a noticeable difference . I love the 117 as well and think it is BY FAR the best Dynergy racket TF has made . <p> I agree entirely with JB . I have used the Dynergy Tour 125 ( this is my \" go-to \" racket ) , the Dynergy Kickstep 125 , this new Dynergy Flexarm 117 but also the carboflex 125 . I also find that I have to bring my \" A game \" to court if I going to use the Dynergy Flexarm . Its really powerful and precise but only if you hit the ball well ( the racket seems to have a small sweet spot ) . The older Dynergy Tour 125 is maybe not quite as powerful but its a whole heap more forgiving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also personally find the older Dynergy Tour 125 more balanced ( the Flexarm is slightly more head heavy ) and so I just find the older model more comfortable to use most of the time . OK , so what I generally do is warm up and start playing with the older Dynergy Tour 125 and if I \\'m \" in the zone \" I \\'ll switch to the Flexarm to wreak maximum havoc on my opponent . The Flexarm really does have amazing power and control but I \\'ve got to be playing really well to tap into it . I therefore suspect the Flexarm would be best left in the hands of high level experts/pros . If I have n\\'t brought my \" A game \" to court then I \\'ll just stick with the Dynergy Tour 125 but the Carboflex 125 would also be a really good racket under these conditions . I have n\\'t used the carboflex 125 as much but it is really nice and balanced and I find it definitely does offer excellent control and forgiveness on those \" off days \" . It just does n\\'t  have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert more effort to get the same level of power . Comparatively the Dynergy generates power with less effort which is probably why I like the racket because I have relatively thin wrists so do not have to exert quite so much effort in driving the ball with explosive power to the back of court . <p> By the way : The Tecnifbre website says that the balance point of the new Flexarm is 350mm but , from memory , I think it is printed with 355mm on my racket . So I suspect the website details are wrong because the Flexarm is slightly ( but noticeably ) more head heavy compared to the older Dynergy Tour 125 . Its perhaps a subtle difference to many but I personally prefer the 350mm balance point ; the racket seems to have better poise in my hand ( but , again , I have quite thin wrists so my arm does n\\'t  seem to tire so quick with the 350mm balance point ) . <p> This is what I am playing with . It is very head light , has a stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the weight of the racquet . I have played with the Dynergy 125 , Dynergy tour , and Kick-step and this one is my favorite so far .

I \\'ve watched many of them and they have been a great source of information when I \\'m looking to buy new rackets or shoes . I am an advanced squash player but not pro or competition level . I competed in the varsity team for a major university in Canada and still train alongside the current team . This means that I \\'m playing 90 \" 120 minutes 5 \" 6 days a week . I am 190lb and my style is fast and aggressive . I have a strong volley game which relies on quick turns and sprints . That being said , my shoes usually show greater wear than normal . I had always worn Asics and I was really happy with them . Regardless , I decided to try Salming given all hype behind them . I ordered a pair of Adder to give them a try . <p> My first impressions where positive overall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n\\'t look bad . The fit was good , a bit on the wide side which fits me better . As I took them on court , I realized they are really fast shoes , as advertised . They stayed in place all the time and worked perfectly during training and games . <p> The problems started after the first week of use . Some cosmetic damage appeared on the side and front of the shoe after hard lunges which I did n\\'t mind as long as the shoe performed . Towards the end of the second week , the clear plastic on the side showed cracks and eventually came off in certain parts . As I continued to use it I became worried about the durability of the shoes . At the one month mark the area of the ball of the foot was completely worn off and the midsole started detaching from the rest of the shoe . At nearing the two month mark , holes showed in the side of the left shoe and I could see my socks . Aside from the damage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take my shoe off and readjust between games . Also , the minimal cushioning made my heel hurt badly ( probably my fault for not doing the research ) which I was able to help with better insoles . <p> After this I contacted Salming North America and they told me to return them for a new pair . I have to congratulate Salming on the excellent service . I talked to Jeff from Control the T ( Canada ) who gave me an excellent and personalized treatment throughout this exchange . If someone is looking for shoes in Canada , I highly recommend Control the T. They have good prices , fast shipping , and excellent service if you need to return an item or even recommendations before making a purchase . <p> In conclusion , if you are a heavy and fast player , stay away from the Adder . Get a pair of shoes with more cushioning to take care of your heels and knees . Overall I would n\\'t recommend this shoe to anyone . The durability of the shoe is not worth the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a fellow player experiencing the same problems I have with the Adder , thanks for sharing . Also great to hear Salming NA has been more customer-oriented than Salming Germany . Do you mind sharing which shoe you have found to be more fitting for your feet and style of play ? <p> first of all , thanks a lot for your dedication , your site is a great source of information to me and I appreciate a lot that you spent so much time helping us fellow squash players . <p> Secondly , I have spent a good year of playing squash and badminton in two pairs of Adders and while they have some strengths , I came to the conclusion not to recommend them , or any other products of Salming , to others . <p> I have a small frame and am a player that profits a lot from being very quick on my feet and persistent in not giving up on any ball . Naturally this playstyle of quick acceleration , stops , turns , sliding and occasional even hitting walls is very tough on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damping , I do not experience the same bruises in my soles and in particular heels that I did from stomping my feet into the floor while lunging that I did with other shoes . Also I feel the traction and stability is decent . Two aspects that failed on me on both shoes constructionwise and that are a deal breaker for me are the adhesion of the outsoles and the form stability of the insoles . While I made it 100% certain I wore the correct size by ordering three different sizes to try them on , I still I had to find out that the outsoles split from the mesh at the midfoot area of the shoe only a few hours after I first wore them on court . Additionally in long , sweaty sessions the thin cardboard insoles deform/crumble and ride up the heel , essentially leaving you with a shoe without footbed . Past weekend I played a six match tournament over the course of 8 hours and after a single close set no less than 1/3 to 1/2 of the insole had slid backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lastly , obviously only important to fellow Germans , the German customer service of Salming is very impolite and not accommodating at all . I had both a racket and the two pairs of Adders damaged relatively shortly after purchase and instead of finding an amicable solution they accused me of misuse of their products and picking the wrong size in shoes when the two facilities I play at house first and second national league teams and several highly ranked players told me I am doing totally fine . To me the price-performance ( and service ) ratio of Salming is just not right . <p> Did you experience any similiar problems with the construction of your Salming shoes ? <p> Thanks for the comment , sorry to hear that Jan . I did n\\'t  have those types of problems with either the Race or Kobra . I had some normal wear-and-tear around my left toe where I drag my foot ( shown in this video ) . I had no problems with the insole , though I have been testing a 3rd party insole for much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks old for me so I will have to do a follow-up review after I have used it more . Your comment is good feedback for other players whove got a similar style of movement ( or live in Germany ! ) . <p> They say the Adder is an entry level handball/indoor shoe which offers a very good price-performance ratio and performs very similiar to the Viper 4.0 . Due to the sole being identical/very similiar to the Viper it should offer levels of damping , stability and traction rarely found in the 100 G price range . With the worksmanship being good as well they essentially only criticize the design as being a light version of the Viper . In terms of fit they recommend to go up half a size from your outdoor shoes since the shoe runs small . It is suitable for those who have a wider fore- and midfoot. \\n@@90398336 @5898336/ <h> Squash Socks <p> Thought I \\'d create a page for squash socks so people can ask questions / leave suggestions on what they use . <p> For the longest time I just wore regular white athletic crew socks .

However , I am not going back anytime soon as this one is a keeper ! <p> Though primarily balanced with precision in mind it gives a good amout of power that can be , of course , increased by changing the chords and/or their tension . <p> I normally find the weight of 130-140 to be perfect and this racket is no different + it feels lighter than it actually is . <p> Great racket . Small head gives you lots of control but also feel . The not so dense stringing pattern gives it enough power . Not the lightest of rackets but try with an extra thick grip ( I use 2 over grips ) and the balance is perfect . \\n@@90398361 @5898361/ <h> Karakal Squash Rackets <p> here \\'s a Karakal squash rackets rundown . This is from their 2015 2016 range . I have never tried Karakal squash rackets myself , but I was able to cull this info from their 2015 catalog . <p> First you have the \" S \" series of rackets , including the Karakal S Pro Elite , which some pros use ; the Karakal SN-90 FF , which they claim is the worlds lightest squash racket ; and the slightly heavier Karakal S-100 FF , and Karakal S-110 FF . They \\'re all teardrop-shaped , with a fan stringing pattern , and a small head size ( 455 sq . cm . ) . As an example , here \\'s the SN 90 FF , the one Karakal says is the lightest squash racket in the world : <p> I have the karakal T-120FF and I like it a lot ! The only thing that i do n\\'t  like is that it feels heavier than mi 130g raquets and is supposed to be 120g !

The difference between this and the Prince Pro Black SP 850 has to do with the shape of the \" O \" ports on the racket . You can see from the picture above , these are oval . On the Pro Black SP they \\'re more rectangular . <h> Spotted <p> I think Mazen Hesham was using the Prince Team Black Original 800 at the 2015 British Open , though I \\'m not 100% sure its this racket . ( Update : maybe not . See this comment from Topias. ) 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I think Mazen Hesham has been custom painting older Prince rackets for some reason . In previous tournaments he used a similarily shaped racquet that was all blue there is no such Prince racquet on the market . My estimate is that this is the Prince O3 Speedport Black because watching the match , I saw the holes on the racket looked rectangular and because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Hesham played with before the new Prince line was out ) black bumper . <p> In the new Prince line the head heavy rackets have a slightly stiffer and heavier feel as their previous models . Maybe because the previous models clearly had problems with too early breakages . I think Hesham and some other players havent been happy with the heavier feel so they use the older models . I think the Team Black 800 is the most horrible example of this : in reality its almost 10g heavier than the O3 Black and the balance point is even more towards the head so the O3 Black is so much more maneuverable . The SP Black 850 is somewhat better but theyve moved the balance point too much towards the head in my opinion . You do n\\'t  see any pros using these two rackets the Pro Beast 750 and the Team Red 700 are the new good Prince rackets . The Pro Rebel 950 has somewhat the same problem , but if you like a radically head heavy racket , you \\'ll choose this one . \\n@@90398364 @5898364/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> @Pierre , any idea what grip Ramy is sporting ? I \\'ve seen him mainly use sky blue and yellow ones with his airstick ( though sometimes white too ! ) . But now , he s been switching over to black ones , white ones and even a purple one back in 2016 . To me , the holes on the newer grips indicate maybe he s using a Prince grip ? Definitely not a Karakal grip anymore though <p> kindly i have to tell yout that you need to correct this article , because prior to using the prince airstick 130 ramy was using dunlop vision 110 marketed before as dunlop venom 110 which is a raquect that weights 110 grams and that \\'s why psasquashtv said he was playing with a 110 grams raquet at that time , and prior to using vision raquet he used the black max titanium he never used biomimetic max <p> Hi David thanks ! here \\'s where I thought I saw Ramy actually using the Biomimetic Max . Its a bit difficult to tell from the picture but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You \\'re right , Joey Barrington often mentions the 110 gram weight , so Ramy may have been playing with the Vision / Venom , though I was never able to find a good picture of him doing so . <p> Hello fellow Ramy-racket aficionados , I am a huge Ramy fan and a few months ago I won PSAsquashtvs \" Win Ramys Racket \" nickname competition . The racket I received was the Biomimetic Max , but it had a slightly customized paint job , which included his initials on the shaft as well as his signature painted onto the side of the frame . Although I ca n\\'t be 100% sure that this is the actual racket he played with at the time , I am pretty certain it is , based on picture comparisons . Another interesting point is that the racket did not have the grooves ( aeroskin technology ) that most Biomimetic Max rackets have . The reason I say most , is because I also use the Biomimetic Max and have come across versions at the store that do n\\'t  have the grooves either . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I weighed the racket , and it weighed about 135 grams , the same weight as the one available in stores . Thus , I have no idea why Joey Barrington at SquashTV keeps insisting that Ramy plays with a 110 gram racket . Even now that Ramy is using the BlackMax Titanium , Joey still says the racket is 110 grams , even though it is listed at 130 grams . By the way , I love SquashTV , and also love Joey Barringtons commentary , but just find it funny that no matter how many times Ramy changes rackets , Joey will always stick to the 110 gram story . Ramy could be playing with a baseball bat , and Joey would still say its 110 grams . Finally , here is an amusing description of the BlackMax I found at an online retailer : \" Dunlop Black Max Titanium Squash Racket : A great super head light racquet for those beginners looking to improve their game.WEIGHT : 130 grams ( Unstrung ) HEADSIZE : 500 sq.cm . \" Watch out everyone , Ramy is a beginner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have to tell you that you need to correct this article , because prior to using the prince airstick 130 ramy was using dunlop vision 110 marketed before as dunlop venom 110 which is a raquect that weights 110 grams and that \\'s why psasquashtv said he was playing with a 110 grams raquet at that time , and prior to using vision raquet he used the black max titanium he never used biomimetic max \\n@@90398366 @5898366/ <h> Tecnifibre Dynergy Tour 125 <p> This is the Tecnifibre Dynergy Tour 125 Kickstep Squash Racket .

It felt very solid and stable , without being heavy . <p> I compared it to my Dunlop Pro GTS , which has a similar head shape and weight . The Tecnifibre was a touch heavier in the head , and just felt more \" dense \" .

Anyone else experience this ? <p> Agree with you on this . After having gone through so many NG130s I thought I \\'d try the suprem 130 and was quite disappointed . The power was lacking and the feel just seemed to spongy , only real way I can describe it ! The racket too did n\\'t  feel anywhere near as stiff as the old NG130 which is something I really like . If you are looking for something as a replacement , I changed to the Eye X Lite Pro 110 Control , and havent looked back ! <p> Hey Pierre , I note from your previous posts that you use the Dunlop Pro GTS \" I do as well . <p> I really like the racket .

Its similar to the GTS 130 but a little head heavier , which should encourage you to set up earlier and take a full swing through the shot , and get more power in the process . At the expense , maybe , of some ability to hit quick wristy shots . <p> Another one you might want to try out is the Dunlop Elite GTS . I just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro GTS but I felt the Elite has a bit more power . <p> Henry try the new Tecnifibre Dnamx and try dropping it down to 20 or like Gautier 16 . I Have gone from racquet to racquet trying to find the right balance between power and control . Prince , Harrow , Head , Dunlopeven tried a bunch of different strings .

I have a racquet with 24-25lbs for the winter and 26lbs for the summer . I feel if you go with more than that with the tension , it will be dead . Also , on one of the older squash forums , it was mentioned that Ramy Ashour used 24lbs on that racquet . <p> Hi Nikhil ! I \\'ve had both from the 2014 series . I would say Airstick is the better and more complete racket out of these . Its lighter and not as head heavy so its got better control and its more maneuvrable . The Sovereign is surprisingly heavy , rather 140g and more head-heavy than it says in the specs . This makes it a bit clumsy . It does generate power easier than the Airstick . Lack of power is a minus for Airstick . But if you want a power racket , I would n\\'t choose the Sovereign 650 , its simply not the best product Prince have to offer . <p> Hi all , I have been using prince racquets for 4 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air stick lite 550 . I find the durability better as compared to the old rebels . Green , yellow and black and the yellow one . I tried the new neon one as well but I think its too stiff . My game has significantly improved after switching its relatively hard to cut the ball as compared to rebel that was 135 . But in return I think this racquet has far more control . Highly recommend for wristy players . <p> Hi everyone , I have just come accross a very similar ( seems identical ) racket named : Prince Pro Airstick 550 Team Can anybody tell me if its the same racket ( maybe named differently in different countries ) or a completely different one that happens to share the exact same colouring scheme ? <p> Hi Pierre , I have actually seen this racket with my own eyes in a shop earlier this week . The racket does exist online tough it is rather hard to find . The only place I did find it in is this polish website where you can see some photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I \\'m on my third racquet and found that the slightest touch on a wall breaks at about the 13:30 mark on the clock . Not happy at all . Great feel , durability is crap and that \\'s with head tape .. Why Prince , why ? <p> If u want raw power and durability go for 125 , that \\'s what technifibre are famous for . But its heavy so its hard on your wrist . Prince , on the other hand , its so fun to play with , its light , hit the ball glued to the wall , cut the ball in short easily , do all deceptions with your wrist . However one big problem is that the frame might break before factory string break . I have broke 2 myself , i \\'m not a wall hitter . That \\'s when i switched to 125s because no money . If u have your trust fund go for prince . If not technifibre last forever . <p> I have changed to this racket recently , having changed from the Head Xenon 135 which I started to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaviness . I have found that the Prince Pro Airstick Lite has a very light pick up weight , with a hint of weight balanced towards the head . While the racket is great for drives and offers excellent power and control , it is also light and maneuverable enough for deceptive front court play and accurate drop shots . The factory string is decent enough , but I will no doubt thread in either Ashaway Ultranick 18 ( Blue ) or Tecnifibre 305 17 when its done its dash . All in all this is a great racket which offers all the power and control my old Xenon 135s , but with significantly more maneuverability and is much kinder on the wrist , especially when flicking out backhand shots from the back corner . Highly recommended ! ! \\n@@90398374 @5898374/ <h> Racket Info <p> I believe this is the 2014 version of the Prince O3 Black ( which was n\\'t black ; mercifully , this one is ) .

I keep an industrial quantity at home , just in case they stop making it . \\n@@90398381 @5898381/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> @Pierre , any idea what grip Ramy is sporting ? I \\'ve seen him mainly use sky blue and yellow ones with his airstick ( though sometimes white too ! ) . But now , he s been switching over to black ones , white ones and even a purple one back in 2016 . To me , the holes on the newer grips indicate maybe he s using a Prince grip ? Definitely not a Karakal grip anymore though <p> kindly i have to tell yout that you need to correct this article , because prior to using the prince airstick 130 ramy was using dunlop vision 110 marketed before as dunlop venom 110 which is a raquect that weights 110 grams and that \\'s why psasquashtv said he was playing with a 110 grams raquet at that time , and prior to using vision raquet he used the black max titanium he never used biomimetic max <p> Hi David thanks ! here \\'s where I thought I saw Ramy actually using the Biomimetic Max . Its a bit difficult to tell from the picture but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You \\'re right , Joey Barrington often mentions the 110 gram weight , so Ramy may have been playing with the Vision / Venom , though I was never able to find a good picture of him doing so . <p> Hello fellow Ramy-racket aficionados , I am a huge Ramy fan and a few months ago I won PSAsquashtvs \" Win Ramys Racket \" nickname competition . The racket I received was the Biomimetic Max , but it had a slightly customized paint job , which included his initials on the shaft as well as his signature painted onto the side of the frame . Although I ca n\\'t be 100% sure that this is the actual racket he played with at the time , I am pretty certain it is , based on picture comparisons . Another interesting point is that the racket did not have the grooves ( aeroskin technology ) that most Biomimetic Max rackets have . The reason I say most , is because I also use the Biomimetic Max and have come across versions at the store that do n\\'t  have the grooves either . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I weighed the racket , and it weighed about 135 grams , the same weight as the one available in stores . Thus , I have no idea why Joey Barrington at SquashTV keeps insisting that Ramy plays with a 110 gram racket . Even now that Ramy is using the BlackMax Titanium , Joey still says the racket is 110 grams , even though it is listed at 130 grams . By the way , I love SquashTV , and also love Joey Barringtons commentary , but just find it funny that no matter how many times Ramy changes rackets , Joey will always stick to the 110 gram story . Ramy could be playing with a baseball bat , and Joey would still say its 110 grams . Finally , here is an amusing description of the BlackMax I found at an online retailer : \" Dunlop Black Max Titanium Squash Racket : A great super head light racquet for those beginners looking to improve their game.WEIGHT : 130 grams ( Unstrung ) HEADSIZE : 500 sq.cm . \" Watch out everyone , Ramy is a beginner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have to tell you that you need to correct this article , because prior to using the prince airstick 130 ramy was using dunlop vision 110 marketed before as dunlop venom 110 which is a raquect that weights 110 grams and that \\'s why psasquashtv said he was playing with a 110 grams raquet at that time , and prior to using vision raquet he used the black max titanium he never used biomimetic max \\n@@90398382 @5898382/ <h> Spotted <h> Tecnifibre Suprem 130 Reviews <p> I had a chance to hit with the Tecnifibre Suprem 130 the other day . I really enjoyed this racket . Its light ( 130 grams ) and , according to the specs , just a teeeeeeensy bit head light ( 34.5 cm ) , but it felt like an even balance . <p> I got a very nice feel on the ball with this racket . It felt very solid and stable , without being heavy . <p> I compared it to my Dunlop Pro GTS , which has a similar head shape and weight . The Tecnifibre was a touch heavier in the head , and just felt more \" dense \" . In other words the Dunlop felt like it had more flexibility in the shaft and was maybe more appropriate for quick , wristy shots , while the Tecnifibre Suprem 130 encouraged a smooth swing with solid contact . <p> All things considered I really like this racket . <p> Image via tecnifibre.com <p> Heres what Paul \" Suprem \" Hargrave had to say about this racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rackets ) . He classes this as a \" control \" racket and I agree with him : 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I loved my Tecnifibre NG 130 . I went to demo the Tecnifibre Suprem 130 hoping I would get the same experience , but was disappointed . I just felt the feel and power was n\\'t the same . Anyone else experience this ? <p> Agree with you on this . After having gone through so many NG130s I thought I \\'d try the suprem 130 and was quite disappointed . The power was lacking and the feel just seemed to spongy , only real way I can describe it ! The racket too did n\\'t  feel anywhere near as stiff as the old NG130 which is something I really like . If you are looking for something as a replacement , I changed to the Eye X Lite Pro 110 Control , and havent looked back ! <p> Hey Pierre , I note from your previous posts that you use the Dunlop Pro GTS \" I do as well . <p> I really like the racket . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more power on the ball \" I \\'m already running quite a low tension : 25lbs on the GTS but would n\\'t mind putting in maybe a little less effort , its marginal but something I \\'m considering . <p> ( Since I \\'m not set on strings or tension just yet Imc considering dropping tension further by a few lbs ) . <p> I like the more classic shape of the GTS and the Suprems and the feel that shape gives , my question is : <p> Do you feel any of the Technifibre Suprem range might tick the power box for me ? <p> Hi Henry , I do think the Suprem 125 would be interesting for you to try . Its similar to the GTS 130 but a little head heavier , which should encourage you to set up earlier and take a full swing through the shot , and get more power in the process . At the expense , maybe , of some ability to hit quick wristy shots . <p> Another one you might want to try out is the Dunlop Elite GTS . I just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro GTS but I felt the Elite has a bit more power . <p> Henry try the new Tecnifibre Dnamx and try dropping it down to 20 or like Gautier 16 . I Have gone from racquet to racquet trying to find the right balance between power and control . Prince , Harrow , Head , Dunlopeven tried a bunch of different strings . Then started playing around with tensions and an old favorite Tecnifibre NG130 strung with Dnamx at 16 and well seems to be a great combination breathing new life in an old favorite . Enjoy the game ! \\n@@90398384 @5898384/ <h> Comments <p> Range between 24-26lbs . I have a racquet with 24-25lbs for the winter and 26lbs for the summer . I feel if you go with more than that with the tension , it will be dead . Also , on one of the older squash forums , it was mentioned that Ramy Ashour used 24lbs on that racquet . <p> Hi Nikhil ! I \\'ve had both from the 2014 series . I would say Airstick is the better and more complete racket out of these . Its lighter and not as head heavy so its got better control and its more maneuvrable . The Sovereign is surprisingly heavy , rather 140g and more head-heavy than it says in the specs . This makes it a bit clumsy . It does generate power easier than the Airstick . Lack of power is a minus for Airstick . But if you want a power racket , I would n\\'t choose the Sovereign 650 , its simply not the best product Prince have to offer . <p> Hi all , I have been using prince racquets for 4 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air stick lite 550 . I find the durability better as compared to the old rebels . Green , yellow and black and the yellow one . I tried the new neon one as well but I think its too stiff . My game has significantly improved after switching its relatively hard to cut the ball as compared to rebel that was 135 . But in return I think this racquet has far more control . Highly recommend for wristy players . <p> Hi everyone , I have just come accross a very similar ( seems identical ) racket named : Prince Pro Airstick 550 Team Can anybody tell me if its the same racket ( maybe named differently in different countries ) or a completely different one that happens to share the exact same colouring scheme ? <p> Hi Pierre , I have actually seen this racket with my own eyes in a shop earlier this week . The racket does exist online tough it is rather hard to find . The only place I did find it in is this polish website where you can see some photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I \\'m on my third racquet and found that the slightest touch on a wall breaks at about the 13:30 mark on the clock . Not happy at all . Great feel , durability is crap and that \\'s with head tape .. Why Prince , why ? <p> If u want raw power and durability go for 125 , that \\'s what technifibre are famous for . But its heavy so its hard on your wrist . Prince , on the other hand , its so fun to play with , its light , hit the ball glued to the wall , cut the ball in short easily , do all deceptions with your wrist . However one big problem is that the frame might break before factory string break . I have broke 2 myself , i \\'m not a wall hitter . That \\'s when i switched to 125s because no money . If u have your trust fund go for prince . If not technifibre last forever . <p> I have changed to this racket recently , having changed from the Head Xenon 135 which I started to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaviness . I have found that the Prince Pro Airstick Lite has a very light pick up weight , with a hint of weight balanced towards the head . While the racket is great for drives and offers excellent power and control , it is also light and maneuverable enough for deceptive front court play and accurate drop shots . The factory string is decent enough , but I will no doubt thread in either Ashaway Ultranick 18 ( Blue ) or Tecnifibre 305 17 when its done its dash . All in all this is a great racket which offers all the power and control my old Xenon 135s , but with significantly more maneuverability and is much kinder on the wrist , especially when flicking out backhand shots from the back corner . Highly recommended ! ! \\n@@90398386 @5898386/ <h> What \\'s the Best Squash Racket for Power ? AskSquashSource <p> What \\'s #AskSquashSource ? ( 1 ) You ask me a question .

He is currently playing with the Black Knight Ion Cannon PS .

Its got the teardrop head shape , which should lengthen the string bed and give you more pop . Its a medium weight , and slightly head-heavy , which should help you carve through the ball .

Check out the comments of that post readers generally love the power . 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I have found the Ram Power 130G Racquet available in Hong Kong to be the most powerful racquet on the market today . It hits with no vibration and the ball is clocked for speeds at upwards on 133 MPHwith the speed gun . <p> Available from the Pro at the HK Cricket Club ( Chad ) at a great price too . <p> I \\'ve recently switched to the Karakal sn-90 ( when when strung and grippedn+its nowhere near 90 grams by the way ! ) Its very lightn+and without doubt the most powerfull racket I have tried . Its a greatn+fun racket to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel . It is one of those rackets that feels like more of an extension to your arm . <p> I \\'ve hit with most of the Black Knight range in recent years and the PS Ion Cannon is definitely the most powerful racket that they produce .

Aside from the 10 gram weight difference , the other thing is the stringing pattern is a bit different on the 135 more of a fan shape . Here are the two side by side so you can kind of see what I mean : <p> Dunlop Biomimetic Revelation 135Dunlop Biomimetic Revelation 125 <h> Dunlop Biomimetic Revelation 135 Reviews <p> here \\'s a review from Paul at PDH Sports , comparing the 125 versus the 135 . He says he has a hard time picking a favorite between the two , but the 135 gives you a bit more power , and the 125 is more maneuverable . <p> here \\'s my own take on the 135 and how I think it compares to the 125 . Basically I agree with Paul the 135 has more power . I like the 135 better . <h> Comments <p> I bought this racket partly based on this review . I really like it . However , I think it is strange that Dunlop classifies this racket as a head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it is head heavy . Everybody that has tried my racket spontaneously mentioned the head heavy feel . <p> So , again , I liked it but think it is incorrectly classified as head light . <p> I was expecting a lot from the Revelation 135 ( based on most reviews ) , but after playing with it for a few hours I have to agree with your point of view : heavy feel , does n\\'t  add as much power as expected and and not too accurate . I \\'m giving it a few more chances though , hoping it will grow on me . <p> I \\'m an intermidiate level player who likes to attack the ball , but I also need a good control . I would like a power racket but with some control . Between Dunlop elite GTS , Dunlop revelation 135 and dunlop revelation 125 which do you recomend ? \\n@@90398389 @5898389/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> The structure of this shoe and the features incorporated by ASICS more than compensate for the little extra weight when compared to other models . I \\'ve used several other ASICS models with lesser features and lighter in weight , but they do not compare to the Sensei shoe . In my experience , the stability and cushioning of this shoe contributes much more positively to on-court agility when compared to a less supportive and potentially lighter weight version . <p> Once you get the break-in period over ( approximately four good matches ) these shoes really grip the floor while providing superior cushioning and ankle support . <p> Hi I have these shoes and I would recommend them to players with specific need for protection . The balance between weight and dampening in good shoes , equals relation racket power vs control . I am older and plays every day , so to save my knees , hips , heels , achilles , ankels and keep me in the game , I come to appreciate the max dampening unique to this model ( Mizuno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes like Asics Fastball and the Blade 4 both 366grams us11 . They are about 40 grams lighter than the Sensei(406g) . Definitely lighter , but definitely not so much dampening , so I can only use them when my legs are not in pain ( which is nearly never ) or for specially important matches when you need to fly . So Sensei for me perfect shoes for to keep me in the game on steady daily basis , avoiding Plantar Fasciitis and other leg/feet trouble that can set out of play for a long time and ruin your season and even(Squash)life . Hevy shoes also gives bigger leg muscle ! <p> I have had these shoes for about three weeks now and have probably had 10 games in them . They are now worn in and my view is that they are okay but not as nice as the Gel Progressives I had previously . They seem to fit slightly higher up the foot and rub my ankle a little and do n\\'t  fit me personally as well as my old shoes . <p> In a more general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the area where the base of my big toe gets dragged and they look a bit scruffy . Worst of all though is that they feel much heavier than the Gel Progressives and this is noticeable on court . <p> I cant say I really recommend these and would point people to the Gel Progressives as a better Asics shoe for around the same price . <p> The only real plus is that everyone says how nice they look but that certainly does not outweigh the extra weight and cumbersome nature of these shoes . Sorry I can not be more positive . Asics are great but they have models that I think are much better than these . \\n@@90398390 @5898390/ <h> Harrow Vibe <p> Well here \\'s the Harrow Vibe , which comes in a few styles . Apparently this racket was originally produced as a lighter version of the Harrow Mojo , which I \\'ve never posted . Anyway Jonathan Power ended up making a custom signature version of this racket , and they have continued it with new versions over the years . <p> I think its probably because the version he uses does n\\'t  have his name on it . The other version is very heavily branded and more recognisably Gawads . I guess its down to preference- tbh if I had n\\'t  been given the orange one for free I would have picked the black one . <p> actually Karim is still using a dark navy harrow vibe .. you can pause this video LONG ... at 0:36/10.39 .. you will see : USED IN TOURNAMENT PLAY BY KARIM ABDEL GAWAD probably a very specific custom racket for Karim .. maybe only 2 rackets world wide .. both with Karim = <p> i contacted harrow team and i received confirmation from John Burke and Kelly Williams that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also new one came in black color , seems for marketing reasons ( probably Harrow ca n\\'t re-publish old vibe with same color ) so they made a new color ( same weight same balance like old one ) and seems that new one has only 2 letters KG ( not handwritten signature ) <p> I believe they are identical , just different color schemes . Actually I \\'m told that different paint colors have different weights , so this could have a slight impact on the balance but safe to say I probably could n\\'t detect a difference = <p> Gawad has got his own custom design now as well only know because the awesome people at Harrow ran a competition and I won one . Ill post how I get on with it , usually play with a different balance but fully agree with the comments about Karims style ! <p> I have to agree with the above comments about the durability of Harrow rackets . I have personally played with many of them before and I absolutely love the playability of Harrow rackets , especially the Fury . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a junior who managed to break 2 Jewels in around three months and she \\'s far from what youd classify as an aggressive player or a hard hitter who smashes the back corners . <p> I got my hands on a demo , because I wanted to give it a try . The racket is actually a really dark navy . Depending on the lighting , its either blueish , or black , so I think its actually the same paintjob , but with different lighting for photography . Wed have to confirm with Harrow I guess . <p> As soon as I placed the order for this , I got a notification that Jonathon Power has been alerted and he is heading downstairs to his squash lair , and shaving off 15 grams from from a brand new Vapor . I will be getting the delivery next week . <p> Ok , wishful thinking on my part and enough with the copy/paste . On a serious note , has anyone on this forum played with Harrow rackets and are they really worth the $200+ price ? What makes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing more and more players using Harrow lately at my club ( Vibe and Vapor particularly ) and the players really really love these rackets . I am interested in Vibe since it is evenly balanced , but have been holding off on it till I can get some feedback on it . <p> Seb , the Spark and the Vapor are very popular at my club . While it seems like the rackets have not changed much over the years aside from a new paintjob , they play very nicely , and I can understand their popularity . If you look at the other top offerings from Dunlop and Black Knight , they are in the $180-$200 range . The other brands offer them at a bit less , $150-$160 . <p> While the the Harrows are great rackets and are gaining in popularity , I have experienced myself , heard from others , and read on the internet comments about their durability . They are , unfortunately , fragile . Moreso than the new Dunlops . My Spark broke within 5 weeks of purchase , and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length . Someone else at the club went through 3 Sparks in a bit over a year before he gave up and switched . A Google search of Harrow reviews online will give you similar statements . So , great racket , but only if you can afford having them replaced often . <p> A fellow junior I played has a the same racket I think and he was angry because he was 6-2 in front in the fifth and I came back to 10-6 to win the game eventually with 11-9 , but anyway he was angry that I came back and hit with his handle against the backwall and the rally after that he broke his handle ( HE GOT A LET ! ! ! : O ) . Was my worst match ever , but happy that I won . Jeroen <p> Seb , Wonder what you ended up purchasing and if you are happy . My son has just gone through TWO of the JP Spark series racquet in a less than 5 month period . Second racquet last a total of 6 hours of playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basher. 2nd racquet broke on a normal wall scrape . He and I have also used Cheaper Wilson racquets and boy do they sure handle an amazing amount of abuse . I purposely tried to break the frame of mine one day and slammed it hard against a wall , racquet is still going strong . So far not too impressed with quality of Harrow based on the cost . <p> To those above with issues with Harrow durability , I \\'m afraid my experiences are the same . I went through five/six Harrow Vapors ( black/red ) over a year and a half . Its a lovely racket to play with , and it gives a lot of confidence to go for shots with it , however I could n\\'t justify spending so much and then literally throwing it in the bin . <p> Switched to Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 , as I played with the 130 prior ( check out both if you can ) . The Tecnifibre does n\\'t  have as much feel , and does n\\'t  give me the same confidence as the Harrow , but I have got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought have lasted a year , with a few noticeable collisions with the wall , its a trade-off I \\'m willing to make . I \\'ve just bought a couple more as I want to play around a bit with different strings ( look around for two racket deals , and do n\\'t  forget voucher codes ! ) . \\n@@90398391 @5898391/ <h> Sponsored Links product i \\'d : 26469 222379 @qwx842379 <p> This racket is based on the \" S \" series of Karakal squash rackets , which have a teardrop head shape and a fan stringing pattern . <p> According to Karakal : <p> The S Pro Elite has the same advantages as the S Series frames with a straightened frame profile to improve power and increase the sweet spot .

The 140 gram 355 balance point are like magic numbers . Its a great combination . <p> I Do n\\'t  see the advantage of this , Just switched to the SN90 FF and its such a nice feel , re-strung it with 305+ and its just exceptional , The usual attacking shots from my game are just easy to play it literally is amazing . \\n@@90398393 @5898393/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> Bought this racket a few months back , its full of power .

Ben \\n@@90398406 @5898406/ <h> Racket Info <p> The Carboflex 130 is made of Graphite ( boring ) and BasaltexG ( exciting ) - technology . What \\'s BasaltexG , you ask ? Well , according to the Basaltex website , this seems to mean products made of basalt. - In case you did n\\'t  know , that \\'s cooled-off lava . <p> That \\'s right : if you play with this racket , you can say your racket is made from lava . Why is that good ? Well for starters , you can say your racket is made from lava . But in addition , if you are ever playing squash and the court becomes covered with red-hot molten lava , your racket will be more likely to survive than your opponents racket . <p> If you are really keen on lava-based rackets , you may also want to check out- the- Wilson Tour BLX . <p> Here is Mohamed El Shorbagy using his Carboflex 130 in an insanely long rally against Peter Barker , who happens to use the Wilson Tour BLX . In case you are n\\'t  paying attention , this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court did not flood with lava during this point , so we are not able to witness the high melting point of these rackets , but we are nevertheless treated to an exceptional squash point : <h> Racket specs <h> Tecnifibre Carboflex 130 Blue / White <p> Just spotted this white and blue model at Squash Gear in April 2017 . They may have had these custom made for their shop , because I have n\\'t seen then anywhere else . According to the product description they are strung with Tecnifibre SynGut ( so , not one of the \" premium \" Tecnifibre squash strings ) . All in all you get a classic racket , plus decent strings , for $108 . Not too shabby . <p> Hi I have been using the Technifibre Carboflex140 for the last 3 years . My wife just bought me the new 130S . The head feels too heavy now for me . Will I adapt or is there a benefit to this ? When I compared the 130S to the 130 it also felt very head heavier . Will it maybe neutralise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I just try and persevere ? Thanking you in advance Alfred <p> I had commented on this racket three months ago when it was when i first bought it . I am currently experimenting with the sting tension for the 305+ started at 22 lbs but no feeling to it and did not generate that huge difference in power to make it worthwhile . Now was 24,5 lbs but for some reason the sting broke after playing three time . At this tension the racket felt much better but now since it broke restringing at 26 lbs . <p> As for the racket , i cant say i am 100% there yet . It feels a bit difficult to maneuver . You have to follow the whole swing and be prepared . I realized i tend to hold the grip higher to make the racket more quick . I do n\\'t  know whether what i am writing does make sense but it feels that the racket is heavier than what it actually is . So I guess next one will either be the 125 Carbonflex or the the 130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dunergy 117 as i play hard thus I do n\\'t  need a racket that primarily generates power . <p> How about you Pierre any second thoughts after playing this long with the technifibre . Have you changed yet . How about stings ? still using the 305+ <p> I have been using the 130 for a few weeks now . Before I was using the suplex 140 grams a bit head heavy powerful but not good in control . The Carbonflex 130 has an excellent control and if you get the right swing the power is unbelievable but after playing half an hour or so , it feels that i have to concentrate a lot in order to hold the racket properly and not to wobble . As for the string 305 + i think its wonderful but you need to be a good player . My previous racket was strung with the 305 green which felt sweeter . Let \\'s not forget I am a novice player with a total playing experience of 1 year . I might try different tensions when i restring with the 305+ to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour game and them i might try the Green 305 although I am not certain whether this is the right move , since this racket was recommended and strung with the 305+ . All in all I do like the racket a lot but I think it needs for my experience a bit more time to get used to this racket . <p> Probably a bit late but still , I would recommend the tecnifibre carboflex 130 if you have a budget of -90 or $150 , because it comes with some of my favorite strings ( 305+ ) and provides power , control and maneuverability , as a good junior player , this world be good because it is a high to mid price racket but is good value for money as no need for string upgrade also this is a very durable racket so i would only buy one because they last years also you can get the 2011 version for a really good price , meaning it is even better value for money but it would need a string upgrade . Despite the fact it comes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the strings making the useless . Also the Prince Rebel one of my favorite rackets is a better choice if you want a more developed racket/higher tec . This also provides better control but not as great power , I believe this is because of the strings , as the 305+ is a power string , and the most developed string in the world ; also it has a larger sweet spot due to the EXO3 technology , plus the bonus of more racket head speed . However the Prince Rebel is not as durable , also it is more expensive but in my opinion it is a better overall racket . To conclude they are both pretty similar however the prince is more expensive than the tecnifibre , so it depends what your budget is .

Founded by two squash players based in Canada , their their stated aims are to offer advanced products at intermediate prices , and to support grassroots squash movements . <p> The rackets are currently for sale in the US and Canada for $100 . They plan to offer their rackets around the world eventually . 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> Just got the PXT-110 . It really surprised me with the combination of power and very \" maneuverable \" head . I actually had to adjust my swing throughout the session because I was getting it around that much faster than with the CNT-135 . I still do n\\'t  like the factory grips at all , but I \\'m trying out the new Xamsa replacement grip , and so far it stands up to the Karakal grips . <p> Hey Ted I just got them with the factory strings . I find the Xamsa black to be pretty decent , but they feel tighter than 30 lbs . I will get the string upgraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 25-28 lbs . <p> The racquet balance and weight plays way lighter than the racquet stated weight and I find the handle far more comfortable to hold then my Harrow VIBE-JP edition racquet . <p> Value for cost , this receives a 10 out of 10 in my books . What I would ( will ) change through is the strings , I just got the factory strings , but I think I will eventually change them to the same strings as on my Harrow Vibe . I did feel I lacked a bit of power with the PXT-110 vs the Vibe , but felt the touch was good overall and service swing power felt the same . The sweet spot of the PXT-110 felt nicer than the Vibe . <p> Overall though , I am very impressed with the XAMSA products . We also purchased their squash bag for my son , and it is an excellent value for money bag . Holds a couple racquets nicely and all the gear an average squash player needs for playing at the local squash club . <p> I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately preferred the slightly heavier CNT140 . I think its because its strung weight ( 160g ) is same as the strung weight of the rackets I currently own ( prince airstick 130 and dunlop tour-cx ) . I played and won a full match with it and thoroughly enjoyed using the racket . I think the whole xamsa venture is very cool and this racket felt great . I highly recommend considering this racket if you are looking for a closed throat racket . Some people Ive talked to about these rackets think that because they \\'re inexpensive that they \\'re not good but that is simply not true . <p> Ive been using the VBO for about 2 seasons now . I have yet to break a frame . It has a lot of power , and I \\'m very satisfied with the control I \\'ve developed with it . I \\'ve noticed that the frame grips the strings pretty strongly , and the strings get very notched , and break in almost the exact same place . That happens with the black string , as well as the green string . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and plays with very satisfying touch . I have n\\'t noticed any decrease in quality from the Tecnifibre line of strings . <p> I demoed the Xamsa squash rackets a while back . I think they come factory-strung with the black 1.2mm Xamsa Senze . I thought they were perfectly fine which honestly is about how I feel about the Tecnifibre 305+ . I have n\\'t tried the Xamsa green strings , <p> I have been meaning to write to you , but somehow procrastinated . I was the winner of the lucky draw of the Xamsa VBO 135 racquet . I have been playing with it for the past few months and I really like the racquet , in terms of its feel , stability , and power . It might actually be the best racquet I have used so far . \\n@@90398424 @5898424/ <h> Omar Mosaad <p> The Head Xenon 135 Slimbody was originally introduced in 2015 , and has been adopted by many top squash professionals .

Its a greatn+fun racket to use and it still provides a lot of accuracy and feel . It is one of those rackets that feels like more of an extension to your arm . <p> I have the SN90 and love it . It does take a while to get used to as the lightweight frame may initially cause you to over swing . Meaning you will need to start your swing slightly later then you are normally used to . <p> Since it is a lighter frame you will get more racquet speed but the frame weight does make you lose a bit of power . To help compensate for that I get my racquet strung at 24 lbs . ( lower string weight = more power ) than my usual 27 lbs . for my other racquets . <p> I like a light racket . Would like a change and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Head 110 for worlds masters in Hong Kong . How do I get to trying one ? I live in East London South Africa .

He says the \" balance is great \" and he s \" able to cut the ball in really nicely \" : <p> here \\'s a unprecedented SECOND review from PDH Sports . Paul says this racket does n\\'t  have much control , but its very powerful and fun to play with . 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> Sarah jane perry has stopped using this racket as of the world series finals . I cant tell what she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a technifibre that she \\'s using ? ( It certainly is n\\'t the pro beast anymore ) <p> I have used this ( the Textreme version ) , technifibre 125S and the dunlop biomimetic ultimate GTS . The technifibre is amazingly easy to pick up with lots of power and is a very consistent racket . The dunlop is a special one ; it seemed slightly head heavy at first compared to the other two and lacks a bit of power but the control is superb after getting used to the racket . <p> The pro beast , on the other hand , generates a lot of slice and \" cut \" which is how ive always liked to play . It generates more power than the other 2 mentioned above , and feels extremely light . One problem , however , is how brittle the string is . Due to the 15+14 string pattern the string breaks almost too easily , especially if you love to cut the ball like i do . There was once it broke after less than 4hours of play ( technifibre 305 1.2mm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this problem . <p> good review .. can you tell me how the new string is working is it perfect or same issue is coming again as i am fed up changing the string after every 2-3 days . which string you are playing with now and its details thankyou . <p> Hi Zari i \\'m currently using ashaway supernick XL 1.25mm at 27lbs . Have only used them a couple of times so i cant really tell the durability . The strings are slightly heavier than the technifibre so flicks and short swings are not that easy now though it should get better if you get used it them . I do feel that the technifibre 305 is more \" crisp \" and have a better feel about it though . <p> I have in fact started using the Dunlop Biomimetic Ultimate GTS now as my main racket as the control it gives me is quite a lot better than the pro beast . The pro beast sure is nice when you do cuts , drops or deception but the accuracy and tightness of my drives are compromised . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My racket has broke ( refer to post below ) but i managed to get a couple of good weeks out of the racket and new string and I must say the string felt really good with the racket . There is more power than the technifibre though i felt the slicing is not as smooth as before ( it also feels a lot more durable ) . I highly recommend it ! <p> Unfortunately my pro beast 750 textreme has broke after just 6 months of play ( i did n\\'t  hit the wall ) . Prince racquets seem a little more fragile and they cost quite a lot from where i come from , so i guess ill be sticking to my dunlop for now : / <p> I just saw James Willstrop practicing for the Netsuite Open in San Francisco looks like he s back to an older Prince model it may have even been the Speedport Black ( strung with green strings , so assuming the 305 , as he s used in the past ) . <p> I bought this racket and have played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrific racket . Easy to get used to and move anywhere . I do not feel it head heavy at all , but I did use some lead tape to give stability to the racket head , makes it steady and give a more controlled plough through when you hit the ball at any speed or from any distance . <p> has anybody used power bite 750 , air stick 550 and technifiber carboflex 125 ? . i m confused between these 3 rackets , which 1 to buy ? which racket offers the most power , durability and cutting the ball short ? ? <p> I have tried all three .. although I did not try the air stick 550 for long as it belongs to my friend who no longer plays at my area . <p> I think the factory strings of both air stick 550 and power bite 750 are great . I feel a bit more control with the air stick but a more natural feel with the power bite ( easy to do cuts with power bite too ) .. they are both awesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel as solid like the technifibre carbolex 125 <p> however , i still prefer carboflex 125 over those two as it just \" feels rights \" . Carboflex 125 really feels like an extension of my hand cant wait for the new carbolex 125 S. <p> my few cents some people may have different preferences and opinions = but i do feel that the shape of prince rackets are about the same .. and if you like the feel that comes with that shape .. prince might be a better option for you <p> There is a bit of vibration in the 750 , but to be honest , its not really bothersome to me . I used a Black Knight ION ( red ) the other day and was shocked at the solid feel , and by that I mean the sweep through a backhand , connecting with the ball , and follow through all felt like one powerful and cohesive action . This is probably in part due to the style of racquet as compared to the beast , and the heavy weight , also maybe the 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little head heavy , I have to agree , but not in a bad way . As Pierre pointed out , it let \\'s one mark the position of the racquet in space , and I have found it exceptionally at quick volleys to return hyper-powered cross courts by my opponent . <p> I have used the 750 and the 125 . The 125 has more power , the 750 better cut and spin . The 750 is great for rails the 125 is a blast to play with . Both held up great . I still use the 750I need more control then I do power.a plus for the 125 is it comes with great string in it.if it is the correct tension .. both great racquets the 125 makes it easy to get carried away with a power game the 750 a more all around game because it does n\\'t  have one thing that stands out above the others if that makes sense . If you need more power in your game the 125 if you need to balance your game because you have enough power then the 750 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul at PDH Sports notes the 750 does n\\'t  have a lot of control . I wonder if he refers to the need for more accuracy or a higher caliber of player given the small head size ? IIRC he noted he could cut the ball nicely etc . There are times I am fatigued or generally playing out of focus where I hit the rim of this racquet and it could be due to the light balance of this racquet that results in it not balancing itself . Hard to explain unless you have used the 750 , its so evenly balanced and light you might not know its orientation in space . <p> I hv played squash for 27years . Yes , prince rackets are indeed brittle . I played with the extender sc , extender , the extender cts followed by ctsII. all were simply wonderful rackets but every piece was so fragile . I recall a friend breaking five extender comp in a month . I subsequently switched allegiance to dunlop but recently went back to prince air stick 130 which I personally think is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it generates really serious power owing to the enlarged string bed . Overall , methinks dunlop is killing itself after the 4d series . I dun think I will buy another dunlop unless its the shabana ultimate or the gaultier elite . <p> I have been playing squash for over 20 years and I use Prince rackets because I consider them to be the best on the market for playing with . However I have broken countless different models . Most break very easily . The airstick 130 seems to be the most durable in my opinion / exerience . <p> Hi everyone , there is a new prince range coming out in April .

Of course , I am totally biased : - ) . Here are a few reasons you should consider it . First of all , studies have shown that its one of the best workouts you can find . More importantly , its easy to play squash . You can play it all year round , and you can play it for your whole life . <h> A Complete Workout <p> In a recent study , Forbes Magazine named squash as the- worlds healthiest sport , beating out rowing , rock climbing , swimming , cross-country skiing , basketball , cycling , running , and boxing \" now that \\'s distinguished company ! The study looked at each sports impact on your endurance , strength and flexibility . Of course , the quality of your workout depends mostly on the effort you put into it , but this does give you an idea of the inherent physical benefits of playing squash . <p> The Forbes study noted that squash burns 517 calories per half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their survey . This means you can get a great workout in a short period of time . <h> Easy to Organize <p> To play squash , you only need two players and a few pieces of equipment . This makes it easy to organize a game , especially compared with team sports that require a large number of players or tons of equipment . And when its easier to organize a game , its easier to stay in shape . <p> A typical squash match lasts around 45 minutes . This means the game is convenient to play , even if you do n\\'t  have much time . <p> Of course , you need to find a court \" fortunately , squash is played in almost 200 countries around the world and is growing in popularity worldwide , so chances are there \\'s a court near you . <h> Bring Out Your Competitive Side <p> Softball squash is a competition . You are playing against another person . For me , this is much more compelling than simply exercising by myself on a treadmill or exercise bike . It means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get a good workout as a result . <h> 365 Days a Year <p> Softball squash is played indoors . That means you can play all-year-round , and in any weather . Its great to have a sport that burns tons of calories , but if you can only play a few months a year \" or if bad weather forces you to cancel your plans \" then you wo n\\'t get the regular exercise you need ! <h> Stay Fit for a Lifetime <p> Squash is a game you can keep playing as you get older . In many clubs , you \\'ll find active players in their 70s , 80s or even 90s . Why do people seem able to play until they \\'re old and gray ? Perhaps because of all the factors mentioned earlier in this article \" squash is quite simply a convenient way to get a great workout !

Thanks to the traffic I get through this Website , the folks at Squash TV were kind enough to provide me with a trial of the service , but Ive become hooked and now I \\'m a paying subscriber . <p> Squash TV covers all the major events from the mens professional squash PSA World Tour . Squash TV also covers some of the major events from the womens WSA World Tour . You can watch matches on psasquashtv.com and via an iOS app , for iPad and iPhone . I \\'ve used all three of those options and the quality is excellent on all of them . <p> The quality of the streaming online broadcast is superb . It is easy to watch the action I have no problem seeing the ball and all the on-court action very clearly . There are a few different camera angles , so you can see the play in a variety of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hear noises from the court , like sneakers squeaking and the ball smashing into the wall . You can also pick up ambient noises , such as the crowd reactions . <p> I really enjoy the match commentary . For each of the mens matches they have two commentators in the booth calling the action . The banter in the commentary booth is great . The guys covering the PSA are quite funny and all-around entertaining . Their insights into the match and player tactics are quite interesting and help me become a better squash player . <p> They also cover womens matches . For some events , such as the US Open starting in 2013 , there are female commentators and full coverage like the men . For other tournaments , there are no commentators , and only one camera angle . It seems like Squash TV does its best to broadcast some of the womens matches for major events that have both mens and womens draws , but this is not their main focus . Even with no commentary , I often watch many of the womens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the womens matches than I can watching the men . <p> While the live tournament coverage is a big part of the Squash TV service , it is n\\'t the only thing . They also have an archive of matches , including recent tournaments of course , but also classic matches going back as far as 1997 . And they are continuously adding new matches to the archives . There \\'s a wealth of amazing squash play available to you on demand as soon as you sign up . <p> The service is n\\'t perfect .

Most people spend tons of time thinking about which squash racket they like , forgetting that its the squash strings that actually make contact with the ball . And I must admit , I \\'ve been that guy on occasion . <p> While some squash rackets come pre-strung with a premium squash string for example , Black Knight squash rackets are pre-strung with Ashaway , and of course Tecnifibre squash rackets are pre-strung with Tecnifibre most squash racket manufacturers string their rackets with an in-house brand of string . <p> Personally , I have a slight preference for the premium brands , but I find the factory strings to be acceptable . <p> So what \\'s the best string for you ? There \\'s no simple answer . The best thing to do is try out different strings at different tensions and see what works best for you . <h> About Squash Strings <p> Here are some basics about strings . <h> Tension <p> To get more power , string at a lower tension . A string under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launching off your strings . Conversely , higher tension gives you a more controlled hit . <p> The reason is , well , think about it like a trampoline if it bends easily , it will launch you higher ( more power ) , but the bounce will be more difficult for you to control . Conversely , a stiff trampoline wont bounce you as high , but itll be easier to control your bounces . <p> I would say a high squash racket string tension ( more control ) is 29 pounds , average is 27 pounds , and low tension ( more power ) is 25 pounds . <h> Thickness <p> Thinner string bends more easily , and that gives you a bit of a power boost . In addition , the thinner the string , the more it will- \" bite \" into the ball on contact , allowing you to put more spin on your shots . So if thinner strings provide more power and better spin- control , why not always use the thinnest string available ? The reason is that thinner strings are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace . <p> For squash strings , 1.1mm is thin ( more bite / less durability ) , 1.2mm is medium , and 1.3mm is thick ( less bite / more durability ) . Thickness can also be measured in \" gauge \" , except with gauge , higher numbers indicate thinner- string so 18 gauge is thin , 17 gauge is medium , and 16 gauge is thick . <h> Comments <p> I \\'m moving to Colorado this summer and wondered if anybody out there had any advice for how you adjust your string tension for playing at altitude with the altitude ball . Currently I string my rackets at 26lbs with the Ashaway Ultranick 18s . <p> Has anyone else noticed that straight after restringing , the ball seems to get coated with some kind of silicon material causing the ball to skid off the floor at a low angle . <p> Strings : Tecnifibre 305 / DNAMX / X-One BiPhase 1.18 . <p> I \\'m new to restringing and wondering if the strings are supplied with this silicon-like coating to aid stringing but then require a thorough clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the stenciling but very much doubt paint will stick onto a silicon coated string ! <p> I tried the ashaway zx and for me it was horrible . I strung it at 28lbs but there was no ping , and just a complete dull feel when I hit the ball . I found that it did n\\'t  even give me any extra control . The restringer has recommend I try prokennex iq core 1.15m . I \\'ve had it put in the racket but was wondering if anyone had tried it and what there thoughts were on it ? <p> I am using the Ashaway ZX supernick 1.25 mm string , one of the best strings i ever tried , its been a month am using it and am really satisfiedMaximum power &amp; control , impressive spin potential and precision . <p> Nylon strings ( eg. Tecnifibre 305 ) will produce a different tone compared by Zyex strings ( eg. Ashaway PN ) with the same diameter when pulled at equal tensions . Things become even more complex , because most strings are made from a variety of materials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be matched when comparing string tensions by acoustics . = <p> My Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 Basaltex Squash Racket ( 2014/5 lime green ) comes with a great string tension when new but having difficulty getting a restringer to replicate the ex-factory tension . <p> The tension range states 20-30 lbs and to start with my stringer strung a Tecnifibre X-One ( red string ) at 26lbs which clearly made a much higher tone than my spare ( brand new ) . When string broke , we went for 23lbs which surprised us both as it is still 2 tones higher than ex-factory . <p> You might all be saying just play with it at 23 then and get on with your life ! But the ex-factory strings seem to have more power , a bigger sweet spot while somehow maintaining touch seems impossible but that \\'s why I love them . <p> Personally I wish they put the factory tension on them , so we have a guideline . I know people will say they have lost some of their tension while sitting in the factory/shop but I think Tecnifibre have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on this racket . <p> Couple of questions : 1 . Has anyone else out there embarked on the same quest ( matching ex-factory string tension particularly for my racket ) ? 2 . I notice that people lower the cross string tension by a coupe of lbs . Do you think that would be done to an ex-factory racket , or this just a personal thing ? <p> I \\'m a musician and engineer ( ! ) and I note that pinging an ex-factory string is a A and my stringer produced a 23lb C. I wonder if there is a rough guide that could estimate x semi-tones = y lbs.now I \\'m sure someone will tell me to get a life ! <p> I was hoping someone might just know what it was . I can tell you its lower than 23lbs which was a surprise to me . I \\'m stringing at 21 next time ( see Tjeerds answer ) . I \\'m also pinging an email off to technifibre to see what they say . <p> Just forget the tensions printed on the frame : they are mainly there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of factory string jobs is usually not very well . Time is money and it is not uncommon that during factory stringing , strings are double or even tripple pulled ( 2 or 3 strings are pulled at once ) . In my experience , factory string jobs are far from consistant and that they indeed vary between the ranges printed on the frame . = <p> You may want to try the \" RacquetTune \" app ( available for Andriod and IPhone ) : this app uses sound to \" guess \" the string tension , depending on some more variables like string type ( ! ! ) and gauge . <p> But what you are actually are looking for , is a way to meassure the stringbed stiffness . There are special devices for this on the market ( Stringlab ) . You could use such a device to meassure the stringbed that you like , and work your way towards this stringbed stiffness when you have to restring your racket . <p> Concrete answers to your questions : <p> 1 ) Yes , I have ; see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of reasons . The main reason is that the cross strings are shorter than the main strings , but you want to give the cross strings about the same amount of \" flexibility \" as the main strings . In other words : to let a short string produce the same tone as a long string , you have to give the shorter string less tension . ( or vice-versa ) <p> Do n\\'t  be affraid to lower the tensions even further to get the stringbed stiffness you like the most . Bear in mind that stringtype and gauge are essential variables for this , and that a fresh stringjob will have to settle and will loosen up after it is used a few times . ( or example : depending on the racket , for cross-strings I will go as low as 9.5 kg ( +/- 21 lbs ) with multifilament strings en even drop to 9 kg ( +/- 20 lbs ) when using polys ) <p> This is a comprehensive and valuable reply . I \\'m very keen to get the tension right and your explanation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23lbs but when I swap to an ex-factory strung tension and it is just that bit more powerful with less vibration my length shots get more reliable and punches to the back of the court benefit from a slightly bigger sweet spot so it means a lot to me to get it right . <p> The answer is 25 lbs with a lockout machine . I \\'ve recently bought a machine , calibrated it and it fires the brake at 25lbs so I guess you want to subtract 2-3 lbs for constant tension machine . I \\'m doing the crosses 2lbs down too and it plays identically to an ex-factory racquet . Got there in the end . <p> Scrap the above comment wrong again ! Tension was lost as it settled in . I \\'m now pre-tensioning the string and doing it at 26lbs lockout which seems to hit the spot for me . After a week playing , it now has exactly the same tone as the ex-factory . Here ends the quest for me . <p> Dnamx it is better then the + and does n\\'t  break as often.great string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in my emailanyway tried the 17 for a bit good but something was missing so I bumped one racquet back up to 27 and left the other at 17 and well after a bit gravitated back to the 27 just better touch feel and control for me in the SB 125 xenonEnjoy the Game ! <p> Hi all ! i have a question regarding the new string to buy i am using prince pro beast 750(2014) and recently my company fitted string broke i changed that to technifiber 305+ guage 17/1.20mm ( black ) but it lasted only a single day however i really loved that.I have heard that wide pattern in this model causes easy string brake is that correct ? I prefer power alot with above average control so kindly suggest me best durable string that have best power rating and good life . Thankyou <p> Lawrence went through a few more racquets really intrigued with the new thin body racquets so tried a few Eye racquets found their weights were just all over the place for the same racquet one of the 115 was 142 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reference each weighs in at 154 . So to answer your question on tension I am still trying to figure that out . One is factory strung just received , the new adaptive string option one , figured I would try it or have the option to try it when I need to restring it and the other is the green one strung at 17 . I checked the tension bed of the factory one and the string bed tension is , mains 27 crosses 25 . The other racquet I strung at 17 string bed tension is mains 24 crosses 21 . The factory one has more control then the 17 lb one which has more power . The factory one a little more consistency , repeatability . So which one won more games.with players I can over power the 17 lb strung one worked well good enough for touch and plenty of power to keep the pace high to keep them off their game but playing the top club player I found the higher tension racquet gave me just better control to place the ball more accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance and win more rallies . So as I said earlier still trying to figure it out . I am going to step the green up from 17 to 20 and see if it gives me the control AND power for both or might just up it to the factory numbers and play there . Any suggestion or thoughts are welcome . Enjoy the game ! <p> Thanks for the update JB ! Hope the 17 to 20 works out , let us know ! Ive been experimenting with the Dnamx 1.15 and TF 305 1.1 , and I find that the Dnamx have more power , yet have a lot of control too . <p> Do you have the same experience ? And how do you think the new Ashaway ZX would compare to the Dnamx ? I put the ZX on my Ramy Pro Warrior and found that the strings were lively and have the pop , yet strangely felt it was dull/soft . I always thought Ashaway strings have the crispy feel whilst TF strings have the soft feel . Or is the other way around ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am on a never ending quest to find the perfect set-up , and for the perfect racket ! <p> Lawrence I found the same for ZX very soft and powerful not the control I was looking for and at that time I was dropping tensions from 25 lbs down and the string strung at 25 or less never settled in always out of line especially after you put spin on the ball . Some say just leave it it does n\\'t  mater I look at it if it is n\\'t straight then the tension is higher then what it started . How can it be consistent , though the ball temp chances also so probably the same thingprobably just a in the head thing ? I would straighten them after a rally and it just took me out of the zone to much . It just does n\\'t  snap back in place . The 305 , 305+ and Dnamx all the way down to 16 snaps back in place ready for the next hit . So I went back up to 27 and well with Dnamx plenty of power and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do the second or first racquet at 25 to compare them . Kind of starting the process over again . Or should I try 29. whichever way the Dnamx really is nice . Enjoy the game . <p> As i was in a rush to have my rackets restring i choose to use the string they have available at the squash club i was playing during vacationsSo i had the Tecnifibre 305 ( green ) at 9.5 Kg / 10,5 Kg . So pretty low tension and i found it very good but took me time to adjust until the string \" break in \" and quite easy on my shoulder . About the type of the machine , pretty sure it was not an electronic one . <p> Dear friends of Squash Source , I need some advices about what kind of strings I could put in my Eye X.Lite 120 Control . The original strings are so good when you hit the ball with power to the back of the court , but a think that the feeling when I try to make control shots could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eye 1.20 ( I don-t know if it-s the strings which Eye uses to prestrung their rackets ) , the Ashaway SuperNick 1.25 or the Tecnifibre 305 1.20 . I don-t want to loose this power , but a little bit of more control could be awesome . Thank you all ! ! <p> Hi , I am a squash racket re-stringer who within my team does about 50 rackets per week . <p> Seriously , do not take any manufacturers or one lone players opinion on control . Control is a very subjective issue and what deems to be the qualities of control for one player is completely contradicted by another , because of what it feels like for THEM . <p> In general though through 3 years of trying to get an explanation to my customers ; ASHAWAY feel/control is based on pure hitting comfort and a sense of firm and immediate elasticity when you strike the ball . <p> Technifibres sense of feel/control comes from the ball feeling like it stays on the racket longer and the feedback is cushioned ( some call this dwell time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as metioned before , it is subjective but if you understand what I am trying to convey , you should have a sense of the qualities on control between the two manufacturers and which one clicks with you . <p> Personally , for your racket , if you liked the factory string , I would do tecnifibre 305 1.2 in a ONE-PIECE setup ( eye rackets only really allow this due to the large grommet holes being limited ) <p> try the mains at 26.5 and the crosses at 24.5 . You will have a similar power feel on the string bed as the factory strings but with the dwell-based control that 305 offers . <p> Had the opportunity to try out some gut string on the prince powerbite 750 PB <p> i liked the grip of the ball but manit was really tough to control the ball <p> added a lot of power it was strung @26 lbs about right where i like itright in the 26-28 range <p> some drops were pretty effective due to the good grip from the stringsbut it would also send balls back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing w/ it after 4 games and found i had a much better time w/ the ashaway ultranick 17 xl ( my string of choice ) <p> It was to powerful for me I used the 305 strung one the most . Sold two one to yourself the 305+ and supposedly the 305 is sold awaiting payment and went to the Head 120 slimbody ! Incredible control racquet ! Enjoy the game ! <p> Tension is a trial and error effort . I would start with 25 if you find you need more power 24 more control 26 and continue down that road.Ashor strings at 25 or so Mathew up at 28-29 and Gualtier 14-16 so it just comes down to your type of game and timing on the ballthe lower the tension the easier it is on the body.Enjoy the game ! <p> here \\'s my 2 cents about squash strings . = Just about a year ago , I started to string my own rackets . Since then , I \\'ve tried some not very obvious string setups . If you take some time to look around and you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings without paying top prices . Some of my favorites : <p> Dunlop Silk 1.18mm ( black ) Dunlop does not have a great name for the quality of their squash strings , but this is a string I would highly recommend . Its a multifilament string , with the filaments twisted and bonded with PU . It will give you fantastic power , with great comfort and touch . The ball really \" pops \" of the strings and meanwhile is easy on the arm . Allthough the coating is quite smooth and Dunlop rates the \" ball grip \" for this string 7/10 , you \\'ll be able to really cut the ball and go fo those flaming nickshots . Very lively string with little string movement . The durability for a string of this gauge , is just fine . Have strung several rackets at the club with this string and got only positive feedback . I \\'ve seen 200m reels for just about 100 EURO , so if you are searching for a somewhat affordable top quality string , this one is definitely worth trying . <p> Kirschbaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics , this is an absolute top string . Like the Dunlop Silk , this is a multifilament string with the filaments twisted and bonded with a PU resign . During stringing , this string felt more stiff and the outer coating is just a little rough . This gives you great ball-bite . Great power and is very , very easy on the arm . The big downside of this string is the price ( just under 100 EURO for a 110m reel ) and the durability ; I \\'ve got an avarage of 6-7 matches before it broke , mostly in the top of the racket . But if you can afford it , go for it <p> Polyfibre Ply Hightec 1.10mm ( yellow ) If you have arm or wrist problems , please skip this string . Because yes , this is a tennis string , and yes , its a polyester monofilament . But due to the thin gauge and when strung at a 5% 7% lower tension , it actually feels quite elastic and comfortable . Great power , great touch and a very unique \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nevertheless gives good grip on the ball . Unbeatable in durability , but with one ( big ) downside : because its a poly , it will become \" dead \" after about 2-3 months of of play ( 4 hours a week ) and needs to be replaced . But if you string your own rackets ( just under 60 EURO for a 200m reel ) and want to try something completely different , its worth a try . <p> Pros Pro Dura Ace 1.20mm ( natural / yellow ) If you are on a budget , this string is for you . IMHO , for the price of under 25 EURO for a 110m reel , this string can not be beaten . Its a prestretched multifilament string with 2 outer layers of braided fibers . These braided fibers give the string its rough surface , resulting in great grip on the ball . This string is very elastic and is very comfortable and easy on the arm . Good touch , good power , great durability . One to have always in stock . <p> Thered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have tried the Dura Ace and agree its a great bang for the buck string . It is to bad it s not made in an 18g 1.10 . I will heed your advice and give a few of your others a try also . Thank you <p> Very interested with the Kirschbaum strings since i have lot of shoulder pain . I currently use a harrow vapor and i wondering if it can be a good mix with the Kirschbaum . What tension will you recommend for good control / power balance ? I was using 305+ with a tecnifibre 125S before and it was less painful for my shoulder , but i really love the Vapor much more so i need to find a string that will temperate this little fury ! ! ! <p> Hard to tell , Michel , string tensions on themselves wo n\\'t help you that much . What you actually should do , is to measure the stringbed stiffness ( DT-value ) of your beloved Tecnifibre 125S / 305+ combination and try to reproduce this on your Harrow Vapor . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combination of string area , number of mains / crosses , string type , string gauge and string tension(s) . Actually , its quite difficult to produce constant stringbed stiffness on identical rackets , with identical strings , even if the stringjob is done by the same person on the same stringing machine every time again . For example : a Karakal BX-130 racket strung with Dunlop Silk with 11 kg. for the mains / 10 kg. for the crosses gave me a nice , comfortable and \" springy \" stringbed . To reproduce somewhat the same feeling on a Oliver Blizz Z5 with the same string , I ended up with 10 kg. for the mains and 9.5 kg. for the crosses . Attempts to reproduce this on a Oliver EP13 , did n\\'t  succeed for so far = <p> If you know the string tension of your TF125S combination , maybe you can use that as a starting point and work your way up ( or down ) the way JB suggests . You could also try to use a vibration dampner , which is probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Ashaway ZX I have it in a Harrow Vibe not as stiff a racquet as your Vapor but a great string so far . Still fall back to my Vibe with 305 strung at 23.5 great feel and power . The ZX is heavier 17g than the 305 18g . I find the 305 strung over 27 is dead to me like a board so dropping down feels good . The ZX at 25 works well . Depending on what you normally string at and string might help understand what is going on . Try either the 305 low tension or the ZX around 25 I think you will like it . Enjoy the game ! <p> Harrow vapor has a TIGHT string pattern that demands a low tension to be comfortable . <p> They used to come strung in supernick and from factory were very sweet to hit with . <p> My advice is to use supernick again ( maybe zx ) , go for 23lbs , and insist that your stringer uses lock-out setting on their machine ( if it is an electronic one ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Past month I have tried two other strings . Here are my thoughts about them : <p> MSV Squash Soft Touch 1.20 ( natural ) The construction of this string looks a lot like the Kirschbaum Touch Multifibre . The string is made of 1400+ nylon fibers that are twisted and bonded with PU . It feels equally stiff like the Kirschbaum Touch Multifibre , but the outer layer is less rough and feels a bit \" wobbly \" . After 2 / 3 times of playing , the string will \" settle \" and soften up a bit more . After some more play , the strings will start to notch and fray , just a bit like the Tecnifibre 305 . Its easy to string , but you \\'ll have to carefully adjust your clamps ; if they are too tight , it will again like the TF 305 \" crack \" inner PU resign . This string will give you fantastic power and good control . Its very resilent and comfortable , a good option if you suffer from arm / wrist / shoulder problems . Durability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of my favorites . <p> Toalson Asterisk 1.20 ( orange / blue / green / white ) This is a nylon monofilament string , with a thin layer of outer filaments . I think this string can be categorized as a \" synthetic gut \" . Its \" sellingpoint \" is elasticity . And indeed , the string is elastic . But in my experience , I had to string at a 5 7% lower tension to get that elasticity working and get some \" pop \" off the strings . Once you got that \" pop \" , its actually very nice and comfortable to play with . The power of this string is just okay . If you are searching for a lively and \" crisp \" feel , youd probably better skip this one . I can imagine that people who have tried this string , think its \" boring \" or \" dull \" . But this string is probably everything about comfort and control . Off the reel , it felt like the string was coated with some sort of teflon spray ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t  like it and before stringing , I cleaned the piece of string with a wet microfibre cloth . And even when cleaned , it is very easy to string with due to its smooth surface . Conclusion : good and affordable string with good durability and a very comfortable soft feel . <p> Tjeerd , just bought some of the new Tecnifibre Dnamx 18g and 17g and strung the 18g up in a Harrow Vibe . Really nice if you like soft strings . The closest to gut yet with better consistency . About to string up an Eye control 120 with it strings nicely also not much coil memory . I have tried a lot of different strings and I seem to always go back to 305 , so far the Dnamx has the nice consistency of the 305 for great rails , softer feel , more power and about the same bite and spin availability . At low tensions , like the 305 it springs back to its starting position each time , you can hear the strings moving around when you cut the ball but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game ! <p> String is the second most important piece of equipment right behind shoes ! Well I am fortunate to have a stringer so have tried a bunch . I have 3 of the same racquets and rotate strings keeping the one racquet with the best playing string in it cut out the other two and restring . What I have found is not only string is important but the tension , and certain strings play better at certain tensionsany way just my findings and thoughts take with a grain of salt I am not a pro far from itstrings to try Tecnifibre 305 for a good all-a round , does all things good , seems to have the right amount of stick or slick to run the rails nicely , natural gut there is good stuff and some garbage one from the west coast poor quality , I bought 5 packs it is stiff as a board and fragile was told it is not for squashafter I bought it he told me.well good natural gut is great all a rounder great spin , touch and power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch but not as much spin as can be produced from the n gut and 305 . Gamma Tour Elite really nice great smooth power and touch okay spin but can move around until broken it and seatedTecnifibre x-one close to gut without as much spin producing . Ashaway makes some good string they just seem to loose there pop to soon ? Great spin and control not as powerful as the Tecnifibre or Gamma . RAB Sensorfibre great string if you like the thick stuff 17L is the thinnest they make but like the 305 with a bit more pop gauge to gauge but drop to the 305 18 and you get more pop less longevity but nice all a rounder . Tried many other brands but none are jumping out to me right now as bettering the above mentioned . I have found that the frames as long as it is what you like balance wise and weight if you put your preferred string tensioned to your liking a racquet is a racquetmy above thoughts are just that and please do n\\'t  take my word seriously experiment it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find your tension and string , enjoy the game ! ! ! <p> Hi Brent , I \\'ve played with the X.Tech 1.20 ( green ) and liked it . Eye says its a similar multifilament construction to the Tecnifibre 305 . I admittedly do n\\'t  have the most sophisticated palette when it comes to strings , but I thought the Eye strings did feel similar to Tecnifibre 305 , which I have tried previously ( 1.1 gauge though ) . <p> The owner of the squash store where I buy my rackets is a former spanish champion of racketball and top 10 of squash in Spain , and he told me that he uses the eyes strings . He , as Pierre , said that is quite similar to 305 . <p> Pierre is exactly correct experiment . There are a lot of good ones out there . Depending on what you are looking for from a string power , cotrol , a combination of bothwill help you narrow your choice , then once you settle on one experiment on tension . You will not believe what it can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tension . There is the popular string by Tecnifibre and Ashaway but do n\\'t  hesitate to try some not so popular brands Gamma Tour Elite and RAB Sensor Fibre are two that play great . Another to try is natural gut but be careful which you get there are some poor stiff stuff out there and ask before you buy if it is approved for squash naturalgutwholesale.com for example says ( after you buy it ) not approved for squash . Enjoy the game ! ! <p> I have a Head Graphene Cyano 115 squash racquet . It is nearly 3 months old . I play 4-5 times a week for an hour . Over the last two weeks , I have noticed that I need to readjust my strings quite often during gameplay \" something I rarely had to do earlier . I have been considering restringing my racquet but Im concerned it will affect the balance and performance . What strings are best for this racquet and are there any instructions I should give to the person restringing them so I have the same quality as earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension over time , which could explain the need for readjustment . Strings are a very subjective matter so its hard to recommend one \" best \" string . I would go into it with the mindset of experimenting to see what you prefer in terms of string and tension . <p> Cyano Rackets can Be Very Temperamental to string setup changes . Basically , it can be hard to get the factory feel in a restring as the string they use in them at factory changes frequently . <p> However , what I can tell you is that they should be strung in a TWO PIECE setup , with the mains running about 3 lbs higher than the crosses . <p> For instance , if you were guiding for a 27lb job ; consider the mains to be done at 28.5lb and the crosses back down at 25lbs . If you ar using powernick or ultranick , remember to lower the target tension by about 2.5lbs also . <p> do not use a thin guage string or supernick xl , as the open strign pattern of the cyano will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want comfort and durabity , consider new luxilon pro shot rough at 25/22 If you want control of pace and spin/cut try 305 classic at 28.5/25 or you could try the new Supernick ZX at 27/24 , I have some recently happy customers with this new orange string with a small reduction in tension . <p> Great advice Thomas throwing out an observation on the new Ashaway ZX or for that matter any of the Ashaway Powernicks or other Ashaways they tend to also move around which all string does but it does not go or pop back in place . So if it bothers you that it does n\\'t  go back in place on its own then be aware the Ashaway seems to move then stay there instead of popping back in place like a Tecnifibre and others . Now heard many say if it is out of place or not makes no difference in how the ball reacts off it . Me bothers me how I see it if it is out of position then that string is at a higher tension then when it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same two attach points so has to be a higher tension it is being stretched . So what I have found in a Harrow Vibe is the ZX moves around as all string does but does not pop back to its original position on its own strung at 26 lbs or below . At 27 and higher seems to pop back in place on its own . On a Head XT Slimbody same thing . With Tecnifibre 305 or 305+ it pops back in place most of the time down to 21 just strung one up at 17 to see how it reacts that low . Again does it really make tha much of a difference that the string is not in the original position .. does the ball change characteristics during the game as it heats up or cools downEnjoy the game ! \\n@@90398495 @5898495/ <p> \" The most headlight racquet i \\'ve ever played with \" Very stiff , a lot of feedback from hitting the ball \" Excellent headspeed from small flicky shots \" let \\'s you hold the swing until very late \" Very good power ( as much as 500cm Precision Elite , despite being more headlight and a smaller head ) \" Very good control \" feels amazing to volley and drop \" Maybe it \\'s just because its so headlight , but I \\'m scared to hit a wall with it .

Ive been playing BK rackets for the past few years , the Ion Galaxy and the Razor TC but the Element PSX is clearly superior to both of those . I was surprised at how powerful it is compared to other , similar style frames .

Mizuno Wave Lightning Z2 is made and designed for volleyball but market for squash by Mizuno Asia . After a week of use I found the shoes is not safe for squash . Since the heel is very slippery and the there is not enough rubber in the heel area for a good grip . I had many accidents when trying to change directions in the court specially when sprinting backwards . I recommend DO NOT buy this shoes for anything other than volleyball since Mizuno does not design , does not have enough research data and they will not stand behind their products if your use its not solely for volleyball .

I \\'m not entirely unhappy with it I \\'ll get used to it I \\'m sure but its so not what I expected from that previous hit and from what Ive read on places like here that , if I could , I would probably send it back for a replacement to see if its different ( I do n\\'t  think \" it does n\\'t  feel right \" is a valid excuse to send it back though ) ! Maybe the one I played with last week had been restrung or something and I did n\\'t  notice but definitely not getting the ease of power out of it that I was hoping for . On another note , definitely going to throw a new grip on it , would like something a bit softer in the hand . Thanks for the reviews ! <p> I have the Carbonflex 130 and my first feeling when i first bought the racket was exactly what you said . Disappointing . The racket you first tried was either restrung or was played a few times . In general the 305+ string is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . So i would propose that you play it for a few months , then you will see the power dropping suddenly and it would mean its time to restring . Either use the Green ( 305 ) string for a better feel or give the 305+ another chance at 26 lbs . I think this could work for you . <p> I have played a few games with this racquet so far and I am thoroughly impressed . The best phrase to describe this racquet is ; As light as a feather but can sting like a bee . This is not only because of its yellow and black colour scheme but because of the lightness of the frame combined with those fabulous tecnifibre 305+ strings . <p> The frame is stiff with a nice thin shaft that feels very comfortable in the hand . What I would say is that I echo what others have said about the sweet spot . When you hit that sweet spot you know about it , the same is said about if you do n\\'t . Although there is little vibration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely not go where you wanted it to go . Hit that sweet spot on the volleys and the drives and you will feel the power of this racquet . I found that I was hitting the nick more consistently as soon I had figured out where that sweet spot was . For the up court shots you can just let the ball come off those strings as long as you have it aligned on the sweet spot , if you want to be sure then a soft tap will help the ball on its way . Saying this I have discovered that using your wrist more in taking shots really helps produce a lot of power whilst using this racquet . If I did this with my previous racquet it would not have the same effect as it is slightly head heavier and harder to power through only using minimal arm movement . Perhaps this is just me but it definitely has made a difference . <p> The ball pings of those Tecnifibre 305+ strings like nothing else . The ball does n\\'t come off like the racquet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The strings are tight and the ball just comes off them with the minimum of flex . This is why it is a racquet suited so well to the fast paced game style , once that ball has come off the racquet you are almost instantly ready to get back into position to take the next shot . <p> If there was one down side it would be the grip . It came with the Absolute Squash Grip and was very sticky for the first few minutes of play but when I got into playing and my hands became a little sweaty the grip lost this stickiness and actually became very shiny . As we all know shiny things are never that easy to hold so this disappointed me slightly . I will try the Tecnifibre Dry Grip and I hope this is a better product .

Like Wouter mentioned i had the same issue w the changing strings far too quickly . Love the feel of the racket ( balanced n pack a punch ) but at the rate I am changing strings , I can get a few new rackets in a year . Decided to sell it off instead . <p> I still have the 2014 version of the pro shark , which is still in fine condition . However , Ive chosen to not to use it anymore as my primary racket due to the fact that I went through a set of strings every 2/3 weeks . Its because of the powerbite low stringing density that the strings take quite a hit every time you hit the ball . If you are a person that goes through his/her strings quite often ( which I am ) , the pro shark might not be the racket for you . Other than that , I really loved it .

Must say that I found it a very unforgiving racket . Currently have the dynergy AP 125 and a cheap wilson 145 , and the carboflex is by far the least clean hitting ( clipping the ball quite a bit , and some vibration ) . Could just be me , and maybe i need a thicker grip and a vibration dampener , but was surprised how many shots i was messing up out of the box . Hopefully with a bit more testing I can get used to it more . <p> I really want to play some shots with the Caboflex 125S but I do n\\'t  know anybody who got this racket The only thing that I can ensure is that the 120 X.Lite Control is an excellent racket . I tested the Carboflex 130 and is good too , but I personally prefer the Eye because of its traditional shape . Following my own experience the Eye 120 X.Lite Control needs like a week of hard games and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings . Once you pass this period of adaptation the racket seems to be different , and you could feel it better when you play with an used and inmediately you play with a new one .

I \\'m looking to buy a new racket , so thought I might ask for some suggestions . <p> I currently play with a Carboflex 140 and I like to play a fast , attacking game .

It definitely feels great . I feel I am able to hit quite deep without too much effort though with higher tension ( I read some where its 27lb but cant find it now ) than what I currently used ( 25lb on old Head Cyano Power 135 as primary racket , same Supernick ZX string ) . It definitely feels lighter than Carboflex 125S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little with the 125S being less agile and a tad head-heavy but it might just be I need more time getting used to it . <p> I felt that I have better control with GWS 125 but it could also be the higher tension . I could also drive tighter to the sidewall but occasionally hitting slightly towards the right with backhand . Could it be its stiffer than the much older Head racket or its just me ? <p> I will be having more hit with this GWS 125 as well as 125S for comparison . <p> The RAD grip does n\\'t  have the same sticky feel to the Karakal . That \\'s probably the only negative . Having said that , its better than Carboflex 125Ss original grip . <p> Also aesthetically , there are some minor paint leakages near the throat . <p> Others : The grip on mine is black instead of white as shown on this site Stencil on mine is \" bk \" instead of the knight logo \\n@@90398556 @5898556/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I was walking back to the office with the Red/Black one on my back .

How do you rate this racket against HEAD i 110 ? <p> Sorry I have n\\'t tried either but I will say its sometimes helpful to have a little more head-heavy racket because it helps guide your swing path a little bit . This is probably especially true for a beginner . I like the feel of a head-heavy racket too ! <p> Its great racket overall my favourite so far ( and I \\'ve tried a few ) . Its great for beginners and club league players alike . This racket feels lighter than some my other ( theoretically ) lighter ones . Good balance of power and accuracy . Get some decent strings for it and you cant go wrong .

I did wear the stabil 11s last year witch were a little more planted than the new Stabil Boost which are the better version of these . Now the biggest obvious difference is the Boost material . I personally like a shoe with a softer heel strike which the Stabil Boost does the best out of any shoe right now . Not only that but the boost material naturally rebounds your foot coming back which is amazing .

This has Heads AFP stringing pattern . <p> Pierre I know you tried the 135 have you tried the 120 yet . If so can you give us your thoughts on the differences ? I know you like the 130 gtx also can you compare it or them to it ? Thank you . Enjoy the game ! <p> A couple days ago I compared the GTX 130 vs the Xenon Slimbody 135 . I felt the GTX was a little heavier ( despite the 130 name ) , a little head-heavier , a little stiffer , and had a smaller sweet spot . The GTX would be better if you have a slower swing and want the racket to help carve out your shot . The Slimbody I think would be better if you can generate good racket head speed and middle the ball . Even though the Slimbody has a larger sweet spot , its not very forgiving if you hit outside that sweet spot . <p> I purchased this racquet and it is probably the most unique racquet Ive ever owned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the racquet . I re-strung it with Power Nick at 26 lbs , and wow , what a difference . This racquet now has so much power , I have never felt a sweet spot with a racquet before like this . It is so nice . If you do n\\'t  middle the ball , there can be a little vibration on off centre hits . I am very interested in trying the 135 slim body and see if its more forgiving on miss hits . I \\'ve never played with a racquet that can dig balls out of the corner so effortlessly and also picking up tight balls off the wall , so great . Definitely recommend this racquet once you switch over the strings . <p> Constantinos have you tried the 135 yet really interested to see how it compares to the 120 . If so one with the optional fan stringing pattern ? Waiting to see how others like it . I have weighed the 120 and on my scale comes in at 150g string with 18g and a PU grip . Curious what the 135 comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enjoy the game ! <p> Hey JB , I have n\\'t tried the 135 yet , but I saw a good deal online for the 135 , it was $129CAD , so I might pick it up . As far as the 120 is concerned , it has become my main racquet . The effortless power , great accuracy , and ability to flick a wrist in the front of the corner provides great deception has made this racquet my goto for matches . I absolutely love the balance , just feels so nice in the hands and during your swing . If there is one knock on the racquet , since it is so light , you can tend to get a little \" wristy \" and \" whippy \" , making it a little harder to hit straight lines , but I blame that more on my abilities than the racquet . In those cases , I just tend to slow it down and really concentrate on putting a good swing on the ball and minimize my wrist whip . But great racquet , with the new one coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these . Also the durability is amazing . This racquet has taken a few good whacks on the wall and is still in top shape <p> Constantino thank you for getting back . Let me know if you get the 135 . I have asked Pierre for feedback on the two since he has used both but heard nothing back . I am really enjoying the 120 and recently restrung it with Tecnifibre Dnamx great improvement . I unlike you have been using very light racquets and finding it an adjustment digging out balls in the back corners and the flicks . Use to Eye 115 and a Harrow Vibe much lighter racquets . But finding my swing is more grooved as I tend to swing through more . Great control great for tight rails like the Eye but for nice controlled serve returns the Head is just comfortable , swings through to return the ball either cross court or nicely down the rail less swing effort I assume because the racquet is heavier . Cutting off balls is great with the heavier racquet I find it takes less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . So it comes down to another 120 or try the 135 . The heavier 120 has slowed me down and improved my game so the weight seems to be good for me . Enjoy the game ! <p> As some other players ( it seems ) , I first had a mixed feeling The first time I hit the ball I felt a lack of power ( and not a little ) but after playing this racket few weeks it give me very good sensation and but sure the power can be there when its necessary . It become an evidence after an accommodation period . I played an eye 110 control which is more easy to play immediately I think but I really think this head racket help to improve the game ( technically , tactically , ) . And the Slimbody is for sure a very pleasant characteristic . Try it but not for only one game if you can ! <p> Marlier I am interested in the Eye x lite 110 pro control and have tried the XT 120 SB so was wondering if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the two ? Which one are you using most and why ? Which one is heavier and is it an advantage or disadvantage ? Thank you Enjoy the game ! <p> I \\'m an intermediate player here in Pakistan . I bought this racquet after reading a few reviews and after swishing it about in the shop . It has a nice even balance to it so I got it . Big mistake ! <p> There is significant vibration if you stray off the sweet spot even by a little bit . My game has gone down a notch with this and the vibration did n\\'t  help a nascent tennis-elbow . I \\'m now going for the Head Graphene XT 110 after trying out a friends 115 ( which is not available , so the 110 ) . <p> Bottom line : Unless you \\'re an ace player who always middles the ball , I would stay away from this racquet . <p> Sohail , if you have an issue with tennis elbow , you should definitely consider a heavier racquet , do n\\'t  go lighter to a 110 racquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel up your arm . The lightest you should think about going is 130g . <p> Restring it I have used Tecnifibre 305 18g and Ashaway Powernick 19 both great the 305 incredible control the Powernick you got it more power . It is definately a racquet for someone that strikes the ball consistently on the sweet spot .. Also a great racquet for doubles with the 305 in it . Just for reference strung with 18g 305 it weighs in at 150g figure 5-7g for the string . Even balance . Enjoy the game ! <p> I just received a 120 and the first few strokes I thought it might not be the right racquet for me . It felt great as far as balance but the ball just did not pop off the racquet . The more I played with it though the more I appreciated the total control wether you were trying to pass a player down the rail or dropping it in the front court . Lobs did n\\'t  flying off the racquet you have to stoke the ball back there . Once I completed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is making me a better player . No longer am I using my power to try and win a rally I am placing the ball and playing a thinkers game slowing it down and putting it where I want it . It seems to be a very consistent racquet . First time using the Head Evolution string , good feel , stays in place , nice , smooth . The ball does n\\'t  explode off the string it acts more of guiding the ball to where you stroke the ball . When I need power it seems to be enough and going were I want it . A bonus the racquet looks great also ! Enjoy the game ! <p> I \\'m looking forward too for some review about this racket . I already have the xenon 140 wich has the same string pattern ( 14+17 ) and same balance point , so I \\'m very intersting to know if the xenon 120 slimbody has a big difference comparing to my racket. \\n@@90398627 @5898627/ <h> Head Graphene Cyano 115 <p> here \\'s the Head Graphene Cyano 115 , which came out in 2013 . Technically this is marketed as the Head Graphene Cyano2 115 , but nobody seems to use the 2 which kind of makes sense , because its not2 convenient . <h> Racket Info <p> Graphene is a flat monolayer of carbon atoms tightly packed into a two-dimensional ( 2D ) honeycomb lattice , and is a basic building block for graphitic materials of all other dimensionalities . It can be wrapped up into 0D fullerenes , rolled into 1D nanotubes or stacked into 3D graphite . <p> NICE . But what does that do for you ? According to Head , <p> GrapheneG technology allows for the first time an optimal redistribution of weight in HEAD racquets . Through the use of GrapheneG in the shaft , the weight in the middle part of the tennis racquet can be reduced . Instead , weight can be shifted from the racquet shaft to more functionally relevant areas in the tip and grip . This unique construction provides players with an unmatched maneuverability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racquet with GrapheneG is easier to swing and enables even more powerful shots . And it will give opponents a really hard time . <p> Functionally relevant areas in the tip and grip ? Sold . <h> Reviews <p> I had a hit with the Head Graphene 115 a while back and really enjoyed it . I was expecting it to feel too light , but actually it was quite fun to play with . It was certainly light and maneuverable , but I also felt my shots to length felt very solid . This was an all-around great racket and I would love to play with it again . <h> Spotted <p> This is a great picture from the British Nationals of Sarah Kippax ( pink ) getting caught on Jenny Duncalfs skirt as she tries to go around her . You can see the Head 115 in action : <h> Head YouTek Cyano 115 Original <p> I first saw this in Darren McCanns squash bag . This seems to be a predecessor of the Head Graphene Cyano 2 115- and the Head YouTek Cyano 2 115 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 115 grams , with a 36.5 cm balance point . So this guy might be a less-expensive option ( while its still available ) . I recently had a hit with the newest Graphene version of this racket and loved it . <p> That is always tough . The factory strings the racquets at the upper end of the range since racquets lose tension over time as you know . So racquet is strung at the upper end , then it gets packed and ships over on a boat , received in our warehouse , then shipped to the dealer and then to the customer . The time that takes varies so the tension of the racquet when the customer receives is hard to gauge . It is really difficult if not impossible to match factory tension and feel unfortunately . That is not just for HEAD but all racquets . <p> I have tried the Head Graphene Cyano 115 today and it was great , solid racket , light and powerful . Also tried the tecnifibre carbloflex 130 but did n\\'t  like it comparing to the cyano . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to buy a new racket but not sure between the two although the cyano is cheaper I do n\\'t  care though . Want the better one . Any comments will help . <p> Hi Geoff , its a bit down to personal preference really , but I prefer a head-light racket for volleying because I feel I can get the racket prepared more quickly , in time to get a ball that \\'s moving fast . Some people prefer head heavy because it helps you follow through the shot better rather than just stabbing at it . <p> To me a stiff racket means there \\'s not much give in the shaft , which means you \\'ll get a SOLID feeling when you hit the ball . A looser frame with more give in it I feel accentuates control and touch . I \\'d say the Tec 125 is on the looser end . <p> Geoff I have played with both and agree with Pierres comment . The 125 Carboflex trumps the Airstick on the power side and control but if you put some Tecnifibre 305+ or 305 1.10 gauge in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airstick and it balances it out more . The + gives more power than the straight 305 but either will really improve the racquet but in my experience not quite to the 125 Carboflex with 1.10 plus in it . The Ashaway Powernick 1.10 is great stuff and light but just cant get it to settle in and stay put after every rally I have to straighten it get it back in place . The new Prince Beast 750 looks promising Ramys new racquet of choice lighter and more balanced than the Airstick 130 . I am trying to get more consistency in my game so falling back to a slightly head heavy racquet with the Harrow Vapor . <p> The Head ( Graphene ) Cyano 115 is also on he loose end . Strung and gripped it weighs exactly 150 gram . I use a karakal pu supergrip overgrip making it 10 grams heavier , but more important , the balance shifts toward the grip , making it more manoeuvrable allowing me to harnass and aim the power it packs . Truely , for me it was never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compared to its predecessor I feel the added graphene makes it a bit more stiff making it easer to play an \" absolute \" dropshot into the nick . I compared it to the Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 and I experienced much more pop with the Cyano <p> Hi all , Really impressed about this racket a friend of mine just bought recently . What is according to your view the appropriate string and tension for this magnific product ? Thanks in advance for your reply . <p> A great racket . I use this as my back-up racket . Very light and very powerful . You can pick this racket up for about 60 pounds and is a real bargain . Probably would benefit from a string up grade . There is a product review video from Paul at pdhsports . <p> Hi Seb , Personally I do n\\'t  see any reason why you should be dissuaded from trying a lighter racket , especially if you already feel uncomfortable with the heavier models . I think people tend to recommend heavier rackets to beginners ( not that you are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weight helps you shape your swing better . Whereas with a lighter racket , people might tend to be too wristy with their swing . I actually asked my local pro about this a while back and his answer was that he does n\\'t  agree with the general approach of having new players play with heavy rackets he thought a lighter racket was a perfectly good , perhaps ever preferred , starting point . <p> Hi Seb , Recently I had the pleasure to try a few shots with the Karakal TEC Gel 120 . I \\'ve always been skeptical about these kind of light sticks , but since I was familiar with the TEC Tour 140 , I took my chance for a good comparisment. = I was quite suprised dispite the low weight I had no problems at all hitting good , powerfull drives . Probably because of the balance-point ( I believe it was 37-38 cm ) that felt slightly head-heavy , helping you hitting \" through \" the ball . It comes ( like all Karakals ? ) with the Karakal Nano 125 string , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you plenty of power . So , my TEC Gel 120 aftermath : good , stable racket with loads of control and enough power on board . I can think of no reason why you should *not* give it a try <p> Hi Seb , I would recommend using a racket that feels good and has an easy swing , it does not matter what people say . I believe you should feel and try to test the racket first ; by hitting some length , volleys , drop shots , etc . I know that can be very difficult nowadays . Go what feels right that \\'s what I did . I went for Ramy Ashour , racket the prince airstick 130 , that was my first racket I brought off my coach two years ago , for -20 it was a great deal , because it used to cost -120 and upwards and my coach restrung it with tecnifbre 305 ! That was just over 2 years ago , by the way this is coming form a junior player . I now use the racket after my first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good junior player . \\n@@90398629 @5898629/ <h> Sponsored Links product i \\'d : 32903 <h> Reviews <p> Paul from PDH Sports makes a good point in this review : though this is priced as a midrange racket , it still plays nicely and is quality construction .

Originally my plan was to video review all the new rackets , but I was n\\'t able to do that in the end . Thankfully , Tom from Dunlop was kind enough to answer all the questions that were sent in . <p> here \\'s a short intro video , which is mostly me testing out my new tripod setup . It looks like the ceiling is resting on top of my head , but I assure you its not . <p> Anyway , the video below is where I go through all the questions and answers in more detail . You can switch it to HD playback by clicking the gear icon , or view it on YouTube to see things more clearly . <p> If you have any further feedback or a different opinion on anything , please leave a comment ! <p> A : Try the Dunlop Revelation 135 . Note : I said in the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range but that \\'s not true the Biomimetic Max , to name one , was teardrop . <p> Q : Just how good are the factory strings on Dunlop racquets or would you recommend restringing . Have just bought a Biomimetic Elite with Dunlop Silk string . <p> A : The Dunlop Silk strings are geared for feel , touch and control , which should be a good fit for most club players . Personally , I used the factory strings on my Dunlop for a year and now am using Tecnifibre 305 1.1 ( green ) . <p> Q : Do Dunlop rackets still vibrate when striking the ball ? <p> A : Havent had that problem ( leave a comment if you have ) but you can use the dampener that comes with the racket . <p> Q : I use Tecnifibre rackets ( Carboflex 125 ) and have always thought of using Dunlop or at least trying them , what are the differences ? I am looking for touch rather than power . <p> A : Tecnifibre rackets have greater power and are generally stiffer . Dunlop does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to the Elite or any of the other top 2014 model year racquets ? <p> A : The Ultimate and Elite are now \" GTS \" rackets . Theyve been made a touch stiffer , but maintained control/feel . Update since making the video : Note , the new Elite actually has 18 cross strings , as compared to last years Elite , which had 19 cross strings . This should give the new model a bit more power . <p> Q : I use the Dunlop Blackstorm and I-d like to read reviews about New Dunlop rackets compared to the old ones . <p> Q : Why is the Dunlop Biomimetic Evolution 120 , which is head-light , specifically aimed at women when Nicol David uses a 135g head-heavy Prince and there are men on the PSA tour who use very light racquets ? <p> A : Boys can play with a pink racket too = <p> Thanks again to Tom for helping get these questions answered for everyone . <p> Remember to leave a comment if you have any further thoughts to add ! <p> Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular basis , with other brands as well , so make sure you are subscribed to my email list if you want the latest updates ! <p> Unfortunately I do n\\'t  think Dunlop makes that type frame anymore . I believe you are the second person to ask so it seems to be missed by others too . My idle speculation is that Wilson is using that mold for the Whip rackets ( I have never used it , just a guess based on the pictures ) <p> Thanks for the reply Q Is the Dunlop Precision Ultimate Squash Racket a better racket than the Dunlop Biomimetic MAX i \\'m thinking of buying one.I have giving up on the Biomimetic Max looking for a replacement now any ideas ? ? <p> I have discovered what the S and L mean on Dunlop rackets ! For stringing purposes , these denote the SHORT and LONG side for one piece stringing ( which as far as I know , is the way all modern Dunlops come from the factory and is the method Dunlop recommends for restringing their rackets ) . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one side of the racket and the long string side only on the other is because the grommets and bumper strip are not symmetrical . There are channels in the grommets and bumper strip that put the strings below the level of the grommets and bumper strip if you orient them the correct way . if you do it reversed , the string will stick up and make contact with the floor or wall when scraping shots off the floor or wall . This will start wearing away at the strings and eventually cause them to break on the outside of the frame there . Done in the correct orientation , the string will be below the grommets and bumper strip and will be protected . <p> Honestly its kind of a personal preference thing , higher tension will give you a bit more control . They may find their clients generally prefer that . A tension of 28 is within the band of normal tension . Do n\\'t  be afraid to ask them about it ! <p> Pierre , nice job ! It is very interesting to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racket you want to have a consistency as much as possible So : 1 . Does Dunlop use different tension for different strings / different models or it is 25 pounds everywhere ? 2 . Does Dunlop put different tension to vertical / horizontal strings ?

Thank you to PDH Sports for providing me with this racket to try out ! Here is a video review . Man , I really need to improve my video skills . <p> This is the successor to the Dunlop Pro GT-X 130 . The cosmetics are different , and this new racket features something called Biofibre , which is a hair-implanting technology . Oh , and its also a squash racket technology , as Paul from PDH Sports explains in this review of both the 130 and the new GTS 140 : <p> Pierre , I picked up a Dunlop Biomimetic \" Pro Tour \" which is 490 sq inch head size and 130 grams and has aeroskin cx . I suspect its a rebranded gts130 or possibly a gtx130. the paint scheme is different than either . how do I tell which one it is ? ie how do you tell a gts130 from a gtx130 ? <p> Yeah , this racquet is great . Similar control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volley and at the front of the court . Even the factory strings are pretty decent , especially compared to the stuff Dunlop used to provide in its strung racquets. \\n@@90398657 @5898657/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> Hey , thanks for the info . I was checking out the Gel Blast 5 at the Asics flagship store in London yesterday , pretty steep @ 105 GBP . Finally found one online for 60 bucks . Before I pick them up though , would you have an idea of what theyve improved in the 5 over the 4 ? <p> I currently play with the Black &amp; Silver Asics Gel Rocket . Really light ( mediocre balance ) and decent cushioning . The Blasts are much heavier , do you think that would make a big difference on court ? <p> Mulch mowers cut grass clippings twice into fine particles that fall through the turf and decompose quickly . Get some tips on calculating the value of your time and learn how to prioritize your tasks more effectively . <p> I see how that can relate to squash . \" Marketing \" must relate to how one moves on court . Mulching is like staying low on the T and it helps \" decompose \" your opponents loose shots .

If you concentrate and you hit correctly it delivers an unprecedented power and you can control what you do at the same time .

I currently have the vlite 125 control but on the Eye website they recommend to get both the control and power versions so you can interchange the rackets depending on the court ( temp etc ) and opponent .

As I said before I had a 120 X.Lite Pro Power and I sold it because it was too much power for me . <p> I have the power and control in the 115 v lite . Unfortunately the rackets are not just different in string pattern but weight . Both strung with Dnamx 18g and Black Knight Supergrips the control is slightly head light , the power , head heavy to even . The control weighs in at 142 grams the power 160 grams yes 160 grams . Maybe they mistakenly painted a 125 power the 115 paint scheme ? Got me but they are totally different rackets . Eye is thinking about my question to them so see what they say . The power control thing using different string spacing is n\\'t new I recently had a Prince Pro Beast 750 with the same concept and it works as advertised great spin and power . The two Eyes I have play incredibly different the control that and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power well at 160 grams it should have more power then the 142 gram control and it does . The powers spin and touch are great but rails are tighter with the control.So do I have an anomaly a one of with the115 160 gram power ? Something does n\\'t  seem correct .. So which one do I prefer.the control feels better great for attacking and cutting off to dominate the t but the power slows the game down more full sweeping swings more of a length game just very different rackets . Enjoy the game ! \\n@@90398725 @5898725/ <h> Salming Race R9 Mid <p> Well well , its the Salming Race R9 Mid .

I was scared off by the MT , which I think stands for mid-top , but anyway it means the shoe has high ankle support . Now personally , I like my ankles to roam free . And so I was thinking about not posting these . But then Kenneth Tuttle Wilhelm sent me this review : <p> When I tried these shoes on in a store , I was immediately impressed with how fitted they felt on my feet . The design is very much like a running shoe , but with a rubber sole meant for the indoor courts . <p> I used to play competitive badminton ( Open/A grade in both the USA and Australia ) , and now play relatively high level , recreational squash . Because of the wear and tear on my knees from 18 plus years of badminton , and the general pounding of the squash game , I prefer court shoes that have excellent cushioning in both the heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe because of the fitted cut : quite tight in the heel and around the arch area , then gradually flaring out around the forefoot region , it is important to try these shoes on prior to purchase . A little bit too long and the cut in the arch region will end up feeling too tight . I pretty much only use Asics , but I \\'ve found that depending on the model , I \\'ve successfully worn anywhere from an 8 , 8.5 , to even a 9 . The Volleycross , I \\'m wearing an 8.5 . <p> In terms of play , the Gel-Volleycross Revolution MT were some of the best Ive ever used . They simply never caused me a second thought during their first use on court , which was in a competitive match . And that \\'s pretty unique , as usually when I wear shoes on the court for the first time , or switch models from day to day , I will notice the different feel on the courts surface . <p> When I tried these on for the first time , I also tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first noted the very fitted cut of the newer Asics models . The Sensei I tried on was a size 9 ( the store did n\\'t  have 8.5 in stock ) . Being just a little too long and they were uncomfortable , width wise , in the arch region , pinching on the outside edge of my foot . The Volleycross was perfect in a size 8.5 . No slack side to side , or forward movement in the store , nor anything noticeable on the court . And the grip on the wood floor was superb . <p> And so then I had to post them . <p> Since then , Ive seen a couple of people at my local courts wearing these . Honestly they look so BIG in the pictures , I was scared off by them . But in person , they just look like normal squash shoes , with a little extra ankle support . <p> I have these in both regular and MT forms . Since Nike stopped making the Quick Court model in the 90s I struggled to find squash shoes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruise my heals with inadequate impact protection when doing explosive lunges . However with these and the cyber shots ( they have the same sole and cushioning ) I never have to worry .

Its a handball shoe , so it would be appropriate for any indoor court . This year a number of players have migrated to the Asics Gel Fastball , especially those who were fans of the Asics Gel Blast 5 but have been disappointed with the Asics Gel Blast 6 . <p> I have not worn a better pair of squash shoes for squash than the Gel Fastball ( I bought the blue and yellow pair and found them only on the Amazon Germany store ) . The ability to turn laterally with a solid grip and support while stopping fast and moving back from the front wall is very impressive . I like the rhino skin which is super hardy and avoids the damage ( to an extent ) done by constant friction to the wooden floor . Depending on your feet shape , these can be really snug . Big up from me lads . <p> Based on your comment ( and some other suggestions ) I went into the deep water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , needed to buy it from Amazon Germany ( which I speak ) , and luckily they ship to Australia . <p> Awaiting delivery on Friday , looking quite forward to giving them a go . <p> Good Choice = It been 4 months since I have been wearing them now . Having broken into them well and love it still . They have also significantly dropped prices so you would have got a sweet deal . Cheers <p> I \\'ve had my pair for over a month now and am still trying to break them in . Since new , they \\'ve been a bit too narrow , and the toe beside my pinky toe gets squished . I ordered the same size as my Blast 4/5 shoes ( 9.5 ) but these definitely seem slightly more narrow and less forgiving than the Blasts which also were a bit tight at first but quickly adapted to my feet . Length of the 9.5s is perfect . Am also having a bit more blistering on the right ball of foot than with the Blasts ( despite using ENGO pads ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to sit a bit higher at the heel . <p> Will try to break them in a bit more and report back . Am limited to using them in solo sessions and for matches , have been rotating through my old pairs of Blast 4s , choosing the pair that looks the least abused . With four pairs of Blast 4s to rotate through , I think I can make it to July 2017 when the Blast 7 comes out but am still hoping the Fastball proves to be a shoe that I can make work for me . <p> These shoes are definitely more narrow at the toes than some of the other Asics shoes Ive used in the past ones like the Blast and Domain . And they definitely do n\\'t  \" give \" as much so if they are a bit tight , its difficult to make them fit just by wearing them . I eventually took a hair-dryer to my pair and pushed from the inside outward at the place where my toe ( 4th toe beside pinky ) was getting squished . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be better maybe even gone . I then took the shoes to some friendly matches this morning and low and behold , the pinching was no longer an issue . I was finally able to fully utilize and enjoy these shoes the way they were meant to be . And boy are they good . Light , stable , and amazing grip . I could go on but I think this thread is already full of accolades . <p> So to conclude a bit more narrow than some other Asics models ; take some break-in time if you have medium to wider feet , with break-in potentially accelerated by using a hair-dryer and some pushing from the inside outward . But once broken in , a very capable shoe possibly the best I \\'ve worn similar stability and grip to the old Blast models but noticeably lighter . <p> Hope this helps somebody . Particularly somebody who wants to give up on the shoe due to its slightly narrow toe-box . <p> These shoes are fantastic for squash . The only problem Ive encountered is that , being a left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the left foot takes a beating and is separating from the white foam piece . Maybe its just my pair that is defective . I do n\\'t  know . To try to reduce the damage , I \\'ve covered that area with duct tape and it will last a couple games before wearing through . I \\'ve also tried shoe-goo . Also lasts a couple games before wearing through . Its too bad because these shoes are awesome otherwise . Is there anything out there more resilient than shoe-goo that would last longer ? I would n\\'t be surprised to see a slight design update for the Fastball-2 where this part of the sole is better protected , like you see with the Domain line . <p> Jeff introduces the Asics Gel Fastball to me because the Gel Blast 5 was discontinued . It was almost a blessing in disguise as I absolutely love these shoes ! They are lower to ground which is great for balance and the wider outsole at the ball of the foot really increases stability which especially good for me and my weaker ankles . Even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still there and they do n\\'t neglect the comfort of the Blasts . There was next to zero break in time , which was an added bonus as I was in dire need of a new pair of court shoes ! <p> These are gaining in popularity here in Toronto . As a long time Asics Blast user , the new 6 has changed for the worse in my opinion . It seems many people who dislike the 6 but prefer Asics are gravitating toward the Fastball as a great alternative , and $40 more in my pocket , no less ! <p> For myself , I find the Fastballs just as comfy and grippy out of the box as any pair of Salmings , but more durable . My Salming R1s hardly lasted a couple of months . If the Fastballs hold up as well as all my old Blast 4s and 5s , I \\'ll be an extremely happy camper . <p> Just a little nick-pick in the description : they are made by asics , not adidas . They are a cheaper version of the fireblast . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireblast has : CGS , heel lock material at the top . I tried them on , and they are really good , would need some weeks to break in as it has a rhino skin ( leather-ish ) upper .

Great access to power because of the larger head size and weight but the head light balance really makes it an easy racquet to swing . One that I would really consider switching to from my current racquet ( Ion Storm XT ) . Stefen <p> I will try it in a few day at my club here in Lisbon .

Seems like frame shape has undergone major changes so they might be quite different feeling . Can anyone comment who \\'s used both ? Thanks <p> i have the 2012 version of this racket . I like it a lot . I started using it coming from using very head light rackets . At first it seemed too slow and heavy but once I adjusted my swing ( slower swing ) then I really started digging it . Its strung weight is 165gpretty much same like other \" 135g \" rackets . \" even \" balance is very nice , very comfortable . I have it strung with 305+@23lbs and the ball really pops off with good control . i would say its a very relaxing racket to use . <p> I had this racquet for about a couple of months . Very nice feel , nice for touch players , but lacks power at least for my liking . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very light ( 135g is its official weight and that \\'s pretty much its playing weight ) , so if you know what you \\'re doing you can get some speed through the ball , but the racquet itself really lends itself to the thinking game rather than the power player . The frame shape is a bit different too , I like the flatter tops on the head and in any case , it has a fairly even feel across the strings with a large sweet spot which is good . <p> The biggest issue for me is that its fragile . I broke mine with very little force on about its 10th game , some one else I know had one and it lasted just 3 hit-outs . Could have been dumb luck , but I would proceed with caution . <p> All in all , I was n\\'t very happy with it , even before it broke . I think it will suit certain players more , its not a bad racquet by any stretch , but certainly at the retail price , I think you can find better balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for touch/feel as this one seems to , and one that is a bit tougher too . \\n@@90398791 @5898791/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> Decided to give the Mantis Power 110 II a run and it is quite a nice racquet pleasantly surprised .

Prior to this I was using the original Dunlop Hotmelt Pro . I had been using that for years . I finally got down to my last Hotmelt and thought it might be a good time to find a new racket . I tried a few at my clubs pro shop and narrowed it down to either the- Dunlop Biomimetic Evolution 130- or the Pro GTX 130 . <p> I was tempted to go for the Evolution 130 , but the sweet spot felt much further up the string bed than I \\'m used to . I thought that could be pretty handy , after adjusting to it , when having a tight rally up and down the wall . <p> Still , the sweet spot on the Pro GTX 130 just felt so familiar . The same was true of the weight and balance it all felt so familiar . I went ahead and bought it . <p> Later I found out why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my last Hotmelt Pro and saw they were pretty much identical frame shapes . In fact I could n\\'t really tell them apart in terms of frame shape , weight or balance . So I guess it makes sense that I went with this racket in the end . <h> Dunlop Biomimetic Pro GT-X 130 Classic <p> Spotted this frame in January 2017 . Its referred to as the \" Classic \" . I think maybe Dunlop has brought back this frame into production . I \\'ve only seen it so far at RacquetGuys in Canada , and on amazon.com but the underlying seller there is also RacquetGuys , so they seem to be the only ones that have it stocked so far . According to RacquetGuys , the strung ( all-in ) weight of the Classic is about 10 grams more than the original , even though they \\'re both advertised by Dunlop as 130 grams unstrung. \\n@@90398827 @5898827/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> Borrowed a friends Storm XT racket last night to compare it to my Ion Element PSX and it felt the way I would expect it to .

Tecnifibre supposedly took the power of their 305 strings and merged it with the control of their X-One Biphase , creating one superstring , a creature of power and grace , like the mighty Pegasus . <p> But instead , the terrifying reality is more complicated . One reader said the 305+ 1.1 string \" felt tight and hard \" ( that \\'s what she said ) , and another said \" it was too stiff for my liking \" ( that \\'s what she said ) . On the plus side , this string is played by current world #3 Mohamed El Shorbagy and former world #1 Thierry Lincou . <h> Tecnifibre 305+ 1.1mm / 18 Gauge <p> The thinnest version of this string is the Tecnifibre 305+ 1.1 ( 18 gauge ) . There are a couple different packing styles for this , but I think they \\'re the same product . <p> I was used the original 305 in 1,20 on all my rackets but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrapping the string right away I decided to give it a try . <p> And boy what a revelation . <p> At first it felt very stiff , way too stiff in fact , an impression shared with almost every player who tried my racket . I almost sent it for a restring as my elbow was starting to complain . Laziness got in the way and 2 weeks after my first impression that string had finally settled : jackpot . Its silky smooth . In the long run the 305 Original may very well be a bit sharper , but its harder to tame and quite unforgiving . The 305+ is delicate in comparison , and feels a bit more powerful , but that might be the Carboflex doing its thing . I tried both the 305 and the 305+ on the same day and I had a hard time telling one from the other , no joke , its really close , especially when the 305+ is brand new . But give it some time and the 305+ becomes its own string , not some 305 heir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular players looking for a bit of comfort . <p> I \\'d definitely concur with the comfort statement in this comment . I usually use Powernick 18 red , but have been trying a few things since developing a bit of tennis elbow . Combination of 125S and 305+ was definitely a lot more forgiving on my elbow . It takes a bit of getting used to though , as it does n\\'t  have the same pop you feel from PN18 ( on Black Knight QS NxS ) . <p> hi there .. i will be needing a bit of advice from u guys .. i m buying technifiber carboflex 125 from a nearby store .. but the racket is having x one biphase strings strug to it .. so has anyone tried these biphase strings ? and how are these atrings compared to 305+ <p> 305+ has a very stiff feeling . Very powerful but havent been able to get the control right . You need to be persistent with this string until it works . I know it works for many people but unfortunately it does n\\'t  for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lose power in my shots . <p> I \\'m currently using the Biphase and it has a softer feeling with great control and power ( less powerful than 305+ ) . It basically can do everything . I find that my performance increases once the strings start to fray ( crosses has some fuzz which gives more grip to the ball I guess ) . Biphase is more expensive though and durability is much lower than 305+ . <p> Hi , a lot of guys are playing with Carboflex 125S and in 99% of all cases they cut the original strings out and have it restrung with 305+ with lower tension . They met with Tecnifibre team and told them that they should be sold without strings as nobody is using factory strung Carbolex 125S . From CZ <p> i \\'m using the 305+ 1.2 since it comes out with the carboflex 125 . The string is very durable and generates lot of power . When you get used to it you wo n\\'t play another one = <p> My String Tension on the carboflex 125 was lenght 13 kg and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i changed to the Oliver Supralight and put the 305+ 1.2 on my new racket . It is still very comfortable and i use the same string tension . <p> For me it is one of the best strings on the market , but its very expensive . <p> I see that you have use different tension for cross and lenths. does it actually work better this way ? I have seen this only on prince rackets that have a small throat ( hybrid in between tear drop shale and throat ) . <p> Another question have you experimented your self in lower tensions on the 305+ with the technifibre racket ? I have tried ( probably silly of me ) 22.2 lbs ( 10 kgm ) on my 130 carbonflex racket and 24.3lbs ( 11 kgm ) on my other carbonflex 130 racket . <p> The feeling on the 22.2 lbs is that it is rather num and cant control the ball very much and was n\\'t impressed witht he power . on the 24.3 lbs the same power with a bit more control . have you had a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think ? This is the first time since i bought them that i re-string them . <p> I played with the 1.2mm strings for a few months and I have to say , they are really difficult to play with . I strung it with 27lbs and there was little feel on the ball . There is amazing power but it makes it harder to control and the power slowly goes dies after a while . <p> I played with biphase 1.18 and I found that so much better . Its too bad the durability is so low and so expensive . I \\'m going to try the Powernick 18 and hopefully that will be my string of choice = ) <p> I play this string with my Technifibre 130 and i have to say i tend to agree to the feeling you just mentioned . Because I have only been using this racket for a weeks , at the beginning i thought it might have been the racket but I am afraid that it is the string . The weird part is that this racket comes already with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so I am considering to restring the same one at less lbs and if this does n\\'t  work then probably try the 305+ 1,1 . <p> Of course my last option would be to work to use green 305 , which i liked with my previous racket . <p> Thank you David . I have two identical rackets with the same string . My plan is to use one of them a lot and when time comes to change the string then i experiment o and i see which one i like best . But I do agree i feel the string is one which needs time to get used to before deciding . Quick question as I am from Greece and not familiar with the expression . When you say it dies , what do we mean ? <p> One quick question as I am experimenting on the 305+ 1.2 sting tensions . You said you tried at 27lbs and you were not happy . Did you have chance to try on this string another tension ? I tried 22.2 lbs and 24,3 lbs . For the 22,3lbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a difference in power . As for the 24,3 lbs i felt it being better more control and the power was there . Did n\\'t  feel that it that stiff but I am already using this string for 3 months now and i think i am used to its stiffness . <p> Hi everyone , I use this string in my prince airstick 130 , i have posted a review of it on the 305 string , and i will get my prince rebel strung at 27ibs with this string next week , got to say its GREAT ! \\n@@90398831 @5898831/ <h> Tecnifibre Squash Strings <p> The famous green string from Tecnifibre , which you see many pros playing with .

Prior to this I was using the original Dunlop Hotmelt Pro . I had been using that for years . I finally got down to my last Hotmelt and thought it might be a good time to find a new racket . I tried a few at my clubs pro shop and narrowed it down to either the- Dunlop Biomimetic Evolution 130- or the Pro GTX 130 . <p> I was tempted to go for the Evolution 130 , but the sweet spot felt much further up the string bed than I \\'m used to . I thought that could be pretty handy , after adjusting to it , when having a tight rally up and down the wall . <p> Still , the sweet spot on the Pro GTX 130 just felt so familiar . The same was true of the weight and balance it all felt so familiar . I went ahead and bought it . <p> Later I found out why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my last Hotmelt Pro and saw they were pretty much identical frame shapes . In fact I could n\\'t really tell them apart in terms of frame shape , weight or balance . So I guess it makes sense that I went with this racket in the end . <h> Dunlop Biomimetic Pro GT-X 130 Classic <p> Spotted this frame in January 2017 . Its referred to as the \" Classic \" . I think maybe Dunlop has brought back this frame into production . I \\'ve only seen it so far at RacquetGuys in Canada , and on amazon.com but the underlying seller there is also RacquetGuys , so they seem to be the only ones that have it stocked so far . According to RacquetGuys , the strung ( all-in ) weight of the Classic is about 10 grams more than the original , even though they \\'re both advertised by Dunlop as 130 grams unstrung. \\n@@90398837 @5898837/ <h> Spotted <p> This photo is from the 2013 Tournament of Champions in New York City .

I understand it balances cut and power but also incorporates some materials that are good at retaining tension well over time . It comes only in 1.18mm ( 18 gauge ) thickness . <p> Tecnifibre X-one is perhaps the closest to natural gut , soft on the wrist , with a lot feel control and power . Plays best around 25 lbs .

AskSquashSource <p> Just found your blog , and very happy to have done so ! I have a question about buying a new racket . I am a intermediate player ( in the US ) , and is currently using the Dunlop Biomimetric Tour CX with the Tecnifibre 1.2 Green strings . The previous racket I had was a prince beginners racket , so I do n\\'t  really know much about rackets . <p> I am starting to see some wear and tear on my racket , and I am thinking of buying a second one to rotate . I am also thinking of the Evolution 130 ( Matthews racket ) . What do you think ? And if I buy it , should I also remove the factory strings and string it with something else ? If so , what other strings would you recommend ? I am more like a control-type player , not a super power player , and I am also very quick on the court . <p> here \\'s my take on this . Readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> So , I actually have n\\'t played with either the Tour CX or the Evolution 130 , but I am going to take a stab at this anyway ! <p> Sounds like you are progressing from being a newcomer at squash to now intermediate and probably still on the rise as you work out all the angles of squash . <p> This may be kind of a boring answer but I think you should consider getting a second Tour CX rather than the Evolution 130 . I think at this point you want your racket to be a constant rather than a variable . So as long as you are relatively happy with the Tour CX , I \\'d double down on it . <p> From what Ive read , the Evolution 130 is probably going to be lighter , and more head-light . That \\'s great for a very attacking ( volleying ) player . Personally , I think for a control player , you \\'re going to want a bit more weight in the head . At least , that \\'s what I prefer . It helps me \" carve \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more pace on the ball when needed . So , my guess is the Tour CX will suit you a bit better . <p> As for the strings , I really like the Tecnifibre 1.2 Green . But honestly , I \\'m not too fussy about strings . I \\'m usually happy enough with the factory strings . Maybe keep the factory strings in for a bit and compare the two to see if you notice the differences . You may end up wanting both rackets strung about the same , for consistency . 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I agree that its better to have two of the same racquets rather than two different racquets . Buy them at the same time and string them at the same tension and try to rotate them in play . Also , I regrip at the same time , so the racquets do n\\'t  feel that different to go from one to another . I often use one racquet for two games in a match and then switch if the grip is getting too sweaty , which is why its good to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also suggest finding a racquet that seems to work well and then trying to stick with it for a few years , and if you want to experiment , do it in the off-season from league play . Change the racquet or string tension or string brand / make if you want the racquet to feel different . It makes a pretty big difference actually , so you want to settle on a setup for your racquet / string / tension / grip and go with it for a season before changing . <p> I \\'ve used the Prince Airstick 130 for about 5 years now . Looks like it may be coming off the manufacturing roster for Prince , so I \\'ll have stock up or find something similar .

Did you or has anybody else weighed it with factory strings and grip ? The specs say a frame weight of 160 grams which would mean a strung weight of about 180 grams which is very very heavy , but you said it does n\\'t  feel that heavy at all . Thanks ! <p> Ive thought about this and I personally believe that the Carboflexes might all , straight off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-brand 125 , 130 so that they can price them differently . <p> Another possibility is that when a batch of , say 5000 rackets are produced , and if the average weight off the batch is below or above 130g they brand them as a 125 or 135 respectively . <p> There are without a doubt small differences in the braiding process that occur in the manufacturing at the factory , that can explain the difference in weight between the rackets . This would mean that one single batch could contain rackets with relatively significant weight differences . <p> The Suprem 160 is probably also exactly the same racket as the Suprem 135 , but maybe comes from a slightly heavier batch . basically only difference is in sub-branding and price . <p> I used to play with Dunlop Apex rackets and the actual true weight of those rackets were all over the place . They could be from low 150 all the way to 170 , even though the specs said 120g frame weight . <p> I got myself a scale and I \\'m starting to measure the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It seems that people tend to say that they are not very reliable , and I guess those big holes make it a weaker racquet ? <p> Fernando , I definitely think the O3 Black is one of the best rackets ever ! I actually bought more of them from PDH Sports they had become availabe again . Many Prince models tend to break easily but this one is n\\'t that fragile .

Ashaway Powernick 18 breaks easily . <p> Its a very head heavy racket but still somehow magically light to handle , has a \" light saber feel \" to it = Very powerful , good touch and feel for hitting softer shots to the back as well .

However I have bought the Prince O3 Pro Tour Black after having played with several other Prince rackets and was deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of my specific racket but , since the begining it showed a strange tendency to easily breaking its strings , starting with the original set torn just after 3 games + it was somewhat \" unstable \" to the point I just was n\\'t able to hit a straight drive with it . <p> Taking a closer look at the racket I have noticed two odd things : 1 . The paint was wearing off around the O3 holes leaving a rough edge that , when touching the string , \" helps \" the tearing process . 2 . The inner side of the O3 holes on this racket are shaped with a rather sharp edge that , again , accelerates the string tearing . <p> I tried contacting Prince regarding this matter a few times ( with photos proving my point ) but strangely enough , never got any answer from them . <p> Bottom line I love Prince rackets ( have played with Hybrid red , O3 Silver , Airstick 130 ) but would not recommend , to say the least , the O3 Pro Tour Black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would love to hear it . <p> I \\'ve used this racket . I think its supposed to be a kind of a copy/remake of the original O3 Black rather than an improved/updated version . I loved the O3 Black and that \\'s why I bought this one . I do n\\'t  think its awful like Lior said , although I did break quite many strings too during the six months I used it . The finishing of the product just does n\\'t  seem to be quite as high quality as with the original O3 Black Its not quite as stiff ( a bit more vibration ) and its a touch more head heavy . At first I thought I was gon na get used to the slightly heavier head but I never learned to hit soft drop shots with it so in the end I switched to Head GrapheneXT Cyano 135 , which is my current racket. \\n@@90398919 @5898919/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> Just got the Ion Storm . Striking paintwork all over , been described as \" The Man with the Golden Racket \" these days . Anyway although I cant compare it with the Dunlop cos I \\'ve never owned that before , I would say the Ion Storm works great for me very easy to start playing with it immediately . Large head size , so its very forgiving . It also feels very maneuverable , perhaps because I \\'ve been using a 140g racket previously . But definitely less power than a 140g racket . Love the control on it with the stock Powernick strings . If anyone is familiar with the Black Knight Ion series , I would say that this is one of the better Ion rackets . <p> Is there anyone up there that has tried both racquets : Dunlop Biomimetic Pro GTS 130 and BK Ion storm . Differences : almost same weight , same string pattern and more durable apparently the BK . Dunlop seems a little fragile and needs a restring to be in the same league . Difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of BK . Could you she \\'d some light on this t+pic ? BK just started to distribute in my Region . Not too many players have tried the brand . THANKS in advance <p> Hi Chano , I decided to reply to your question even though I have NOT used the BK Ion Storm . I was using the Dunlop Pro GTS 130 at the beginning of this year but recently switched to another Dunlop racket : the Biomimetic Ultimate . The main reason why I changed rackets was because of the weight balance of the Pro GTS was n\\'t doing it for mealthough Dunlop describes this model as head light that is simply NOT true , holding the racket is just like holding a hammer . I find that on the current Dunlop range the Ultimate and the Elite have a much more even distribution of the weight . Hope this helps . -Juan <p> That \\'s true with the dunlop my gtx-130 with ashaway red strings and that basically turned into a hyper hammer . My dunlop was fragile though the paint below the bumper at the top fades away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many bumps . I \\'ve played briefly with the black knight racquet however the balance to me did n\\'t  work out and it felt quite \" dead \" so not too responsive \\n@@90398920 @5898920/ <p> Today I \\'m happy to introduce a guest post from regular reader Ghostface* about some hard-to-find Black Knight squash rackets . *name may have been changed at author \\'s request Without further ado , here \\'s Ghostface : I have just received two rare BK rackets in the mail today , thought I \\'d Read more ... <p> The Asics Gel Fireblast has been around for a couple years now .

Also he strings his racket at a very loose 22 lbs . <p> Simon , Will , Pierre Thank you for good observations and interesting info on Gregoire \\'s Carboflex 125 . <p> Liam ( the stringer and racket customizer ) states that most pros add weight to the handle of the sales rackets . So shaving/sanding the tip ( like Gregory Gaultier racket ) is not so much to have a lighter racket , but to change the balance point having the possibility to move/add weight towards or into the handle . GG racket is said to be 157 grams and 33 cm balance . <p> Let \\'s kill the powerhype of the lighter rackets , even premium commentators at SquashTV states repeatedly that both Greg and Ramys rackets are incredibly light . Not so , the magical LightSabre , the YodaStick as racket does not exist , and is only a wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords as important tools regarding usefullness maneuverability and power . We all ( should/will ) know that the lightest racket is as **28;380;TOOLONG as the racket with the fewest strings . Imagine playing squash with a badminton racket or one that teoretically weights zero grams or one that only have two main strings ! Thats powerfull beond real , and not a very good squash racket , will probably be called the **26;410;TOOLONG . <p> I can understand that the heaviest squash racket in the world is not selling a lot , and that often lightweight is an important buying consideration for tents or laptops when backpacking without Sherpa , but when getting married we do not normally choose the lightest wife or husband <p> Most of the rackets from the shop are luckily much heavier than announced anyway . Marketing info is totally unreliable . Weight is announsed sometimes totally stripped , without strings , grip , bumper , paint , . Other times , like the Harrow Spark I recently bought supposed to be 135 grams finished weight , weighing in at my place at 146grams . Likevise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams . GoGreen ! Strings are 10-15 grams and grip is about the same . So the Carboflex 125 will probably be 155grams total . <p> It would also be interesting to know how much weight Gregoire \\'s rackets are added ( in the handle ? ) , and what total weight and balance point that would give , optimized for him , and probably for most others also a good racket to get used to , or start of with . <p> In choosing rackets , personal preference is overrated , a good/best racket is more objective ( like a premium chefs kitchen knife or Makita drill ) , and you should get used to it , not the other way around ! ? <p> ( Sorry for length and grammar , but so little info on this important subject for the quality of our game found on the internett ) Hurray ! Ole <p> Sometimes pros can get custom rackets catered to them personally . And taking off cosmetics ( paint ) could shave off a few grams/OZs and its cheaper than making the actual racket lighter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably just that he likes his racket lighter . \\n@@90398923 @5898923/ <p> The Dunlop Biomimetic Evolution 120 squash racket is the choice for many top women on the WSA pro squash tour including Madeline Perry of Ireland , Sarah Kippax of England , and Alison Waters of England . 2013 Version 2012 Version Update : this racket has been replaced by the Dunlop Force Read more ... <p> The Asics Gel Task is a relatively inexpensive model from Asics- that has been around for a few years .

Its supposed to mean that SuperNick ZX has improved durability and holds tension better than the classic SuperNick strings , but still retains their playability . <p> This string is 17 gauge ( 1.25 mm ) , which is on the thicker side for squash strings . 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I tried the SuperNick ZX Micro gauge on my Eye X.Lite 120 Control and the string did n\\'t  survived 10 hours of play . If somebody around germany is interested in trying the micro gauge , I bought a secound set ( 9 meters ) and will sell it for 10 Euros plus postal rate . Drop me a line here and we can get into contact . <p> I just cut out my 305+ and strung my Dunlop Elite with ZX strings at 26 lbs ( 11,8 kg ) with my drop weight machine with flying clamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My comments : Feels soft and surprisingly powerful , with good feel of control . I definitely feel it has better control than the 305+ and just as powerful but much softer than the 305+ . My 305+ was strung at 24m/23c and it felt good for that string with good power and no vibration even though it is a very hard string . <p> I still think 26 lbs ( on my machine ) is too low for the ZX string , because the string moves around very much and will not keep aligned . It also feels maybe too soft for my liking at 26 . I would next time go for 28 lbs to get a crisper response and direct feel , and better string alignment . <p> I think that for recreational/club players it is better to go with thicker strings like the ZX if you have a racket with a big head and an open string pattern , like the Dunlop Elite . Thinner strings in a big head ( 500cm2 ) with an open string pattern ( 14+18 or less ) leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also have a Dunlop Ultimate strung with 305 18G/1.1mm and in that racket the thinner strings work much better for me , because of a denser string pattern . Just my thoughts . <p> I totally agree with you about the ZX supernick 1.25mm , ideal tension is 12.5-13 kg and you will feel the difference . explosive ! ! ! after a week it will reach 12-12.50 kg fair enough , strings still aligned most of time ! <p> its been 8 months am using the Ashaway ZX , as for durability it lasted more than a month . i play 4 times a week <p> Ive been using the ZX Micro in my Force Elite . Its the first time Ive changed strings , so I \\'m still working out what works best . I tend to prefer thinner strings , as I do n\\'t  go through them often , so was looking forward to trying these , and they have n\\'t disappointed . <p> Initially I wanted to try a lower tension , around 25lbs but the stringer thought they were too soft when he did them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ill probably go for around 27-28lbs next time . <p> Ive play tested the micro version of this string and it feels really good . Unfortunately it was strung at a tension way lower than I \\'m used to so it was harder to make a really good comparison to the Ultranick 18s that I usually play with . However , my notes would be that it seemed to play like a 19 gauge string with excellent power , feel and cut . It seemed to play a lot like the Powernick 19 , but should have better durability . I \\'ve also got the 17 gauge version in my BK Ion Cannon Castagnet but the factory tension seems very tight which has reduced the playability of the string . I \\'ll provide more feedback when I get it strung at my regular tension . <p> Over the past 18 months or so Ive experimented with Tecnifibre 305 , X-One Biphase , Supernick XL , Ultranick 18 , Ultranick 19 , and the Supernick ZX . I play a pretty light tension 24lb . The 305s and the X-One gave me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 2-4 weeks or so ( I play nearly every day ) , and replacing them gets expensive for a student . I liked the durability of the Supernick XL , but I missed the sense of control from the 305s and the X-One , the ability to cut into the ball . <p> Played with the Supernick ZX today in two Prince 03 Speedport Blacks . Power felt good , the ball really popped . Despite the thick gauge , I felt like I had the same ability to cut into the ball , and in fact the sweet spot was heavily speckled with rubber at the end of the match . But the best thing was the touch . With the ZX I felt like I was hitting the ball with my bare hand , especially on drop shots and lobs . Never felt that way with other strings , even the 305s . <p> I have used this string about 4 months now on my Oliver Pure 3 . I \\'m fully impressed for this string ! The power and touch is perfect for me ! Durability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one set of strings at this period of time . On behalf of the price this is much cheaper option than ultranick or powernick . Here in Finland reel of powernick 18 cost 138G and reel of supernick zx 75G ! I think this string is really good value for money ! <p> The now unavailable version of Powernick 17 had Zyex as part of the name IIRC . It was a pale metallic blue colour and 1.25 or 1.22 gauge and lasted forever even compared to the PN18 which is one of the most robust strings available in my opinion . <p> i put these beauty strings on my prince airstick 130 . the buddy doing the tension said 28 lbs and 32 for the cross due to the nature of the power ring type racket . <p> i played w/ it yesterday all day and really liked it . for a sluggish performance ( my head and feet just werent in the game ) i felt like the strings were : <p> 1 . a bit on the heavy sidemade for a more powerful ball and better length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to put decent cuts on the ball for drops 3. they \\'re sexyflashy and fun and lots of compliments 4. durableso far so good.they withstood some good power shots <p> Rod just a thought might want to go the other way if you are going to vary tensions to allow the racquet to work with te string for even more power and better control . The mains actually when striking the ball pull the head rounder allowing the sides and crosses to control how much giving the racquet its sweet spot . If you increase the cross tension the racquets sweet spot becomes smaller so less control or less predictable . For more consistency try your 28 for the mains and 27 for the crosses if you want to change it up . Once a racquet is strung the mains become almost 25% greater tension than the crosses if tensioned at the same tension so your 28 will become 33-34 mains 28-29 crosses . Since the mains are so long the tension they put on the frame hitting a ball is about the same as the crosses even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is even longer just wrapped around their bridge . Enjoy the game ! <p> I have not heard this theory of mains increasing 25% . By that calculation , racket strung at 28lbs ( typical ) the mains would increase to 35lbs . And that tension can only come from the cross strings so those have to decrease to 21lbs . That does not seem plausible nor is that my experience . <p> Try it string a racquet at whatever you string at and you will find the mains will be considerably higher than what you started with and the crosses about a lb higher than you set to tension at . So 28 will be around 35 for the mains the crosses about 1 lb higher 29 . Its not a theory it is actually what happens . <p> JB , I guess you use something like the Tourna Stringmeter to measure the tension of the mains and crosses in a full stringbed ? <p> When you \\'ve put in all the mains , the head of the racket will be measurably deformed : the tension on the mains will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of this , the middle 2-4 mains will feel noticeably more loose compared to the moment you pulled tension on them . The deformation of the racket head will be equalized when all crosses are put in , so that will not be the reason for this increased tension . It actually is the weaving of the crosses that will \" pull \" the mains to a higher tension . The result is a stringbed with a certain stiffness . In the end it all comes down to personal preference of feel and comfort = <p> While typing this comment , I bumped into this article . Interesting view on tension of mains and crossing , specially for poly strings . Guess its time for some more testing = <p> Tjeerd you are exactly correct . It has been very interesting to try different tensions but learning also that the different frames make as much a difference as the the string and tension . Since finding this out I have stayed with 3 of the same frame to try to prove out different combinations to see if one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far 305 at 21-23 has been very interesting in a Harrow Vibe , very different and right now I enjoy it better at those tensions than the usual 28 everyone seems to recommend . Great feel and seems to give me much more control to place the ball seems the ball seems to stay on the racquet to place it if that makes sense . Higher tensions it seems to just jump off the strings . Let me know what you find out . The article you ran across did n\\'t  come up if you have the link that would be great , interested to see what it says . Enjoy the game ! <p> I agree , and since trying a lower tension on my Beast 750 I enjoy the feel of the ball on the strings . I feel more control given the ball is in contact with the strings longer , and I am getting more power . <p> Next I will try stringing at 24 mains and 26-27 crosses with various string . <p> Interesting to note a player with great feel , Shabanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather low at 23/24 IIRC . <p> One might be able to to quick cuts at the ball with higher tension , but I feel strongly about the lower tensions right now . <p> I cant believe Selby is using Ashaway 18 Ultranick at 29 ! To each his own <p> Hey Rod , I use my harrow for practice , I play my matches with Prince Pro Beast 750 , my Prince just got strung in ZX , I \\'ve had Tecnifibre 305 green 1.2 , Power nick 18 , in my opinion I think Ashaway has brought in a great string into the mix , I had it strung at 28lbs , its bang on for me , I think I \\'ve found my favorite string !

I \\'ll take it . <p> Anyway , here \\'s what Joey Barrington , the main Squash TV commentator , has to say ( he s also a partner at Eye ) : <p> Interestingly , Joey says the racket is weighted towards the head . <p> When I did the review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just measured the racket and came up with a balance point of 35.25 cm . The exact midpoint of a racket would be 34.25 . So , this puppy is 1 cm head heavy . Not much , but perhaps when you have feel like Joey Barrington , its noticeable . <p> Heres Paul from PDH Sports , who says this \" suits an attacking-style player \" : <h> Borja Golan Signature <p> Borja actually has a custom version of this racket now , in an orange color . <h> Sponsored Links product i \\'d : 18871 222379 @qwx842379 <p> Product description from Eye Rackets : <p> A closed throat racket with a head heavy balance . Although the same weight as the Shabana version , the balance is very noticably more in the head , ideal for those looking for a bit more momentum through the shot . The slightly over-sized frame provides a generous sweet-spot whilst allowing for excellent control and touch . This racket will suit those that require feel and power in equal measure . 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> Hi , I \\'ve been using this racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible problems with strings . I \\'ve changed it 10 times . Problems are mainly that after few hits strings get loose and there appear holes . I must fix this once in a 2 minutes during every match . Last time it took only one game to break new string ( technifibre ) . Did someone experience such problems ? Is there some way i could help the man who fixes the string do it better ? My friends used the same service with his wilson and everythings fine for him Tension i ask for is 11.5+10,5kg . I tried wilson/ technifibre strings . Did n\\'t  have that problem with oryginal EYE string . <p> Hey , I have the Golan version of this racquet , with Tecnifibre biphase , strung at 26 lbs . It also has a Karakal PU grip on it , this racquet did n\\'t  suit my game at all . I would be interested in selling it , if you are interested in buying it . Let me know . <p> So I just tested it for the first time and I am totally amazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gives so much time for reaction . Let \\'s attack or change direction in the last moment , be less predectitable or make a small but powerfull swing . It has great control and A LOT OF POWER at the same time . Compared the power to the Wilson Hammer 140 and its just a bit weaker while control is so much better . My previous racket was Prince Air Team 130 and this Eye is so much better and cheaper at the same time . Must say its a really good choice . <p> That \\'s good ! My suggest is to stick a crashtape on the top of the head . When you play lines and smack a wall it can affect to durability of strings . Eye does n\\'t  have a bumper and strings are not hidden . 15cm of crashtape will kill the issue . Out of records , where do you play ?

I come from Poznan but since a while Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the best racket I \\'ve played so you will not regret buying that .

It has to be the balance the X.Lite label reads \" Head Heavy \" and I would agree . I need to weigh the X.Lite 120. it feels so much heavier than my 750 , maybe its the stock string ? <p> I currently have a Harrow spark strung with ashaway powernick strings absolutely love it but have become intrigued with the eye racket 120 control i \\'m interested to know how it compares with the spark and whether i should purchase the racket ( with it potentially being an upgrade ) would technifibre strings be better than the ashaway powernick ? I really want to develop my game ( also considering the technifibre carboflex as it seems a lot of the top players use it as well , any opinions on this as well ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? More power the Carboflex 125s with 1.10 string , more control the Eye Rackets , a ton of control the Head XT slim body series.dont forget string makes a big differenceenjoy the game ! <p> Hi , I \\'ve been playing X120 control for over 2 years . I had many raquets with diffrent balance and shape . This raquet is the excalibur ! Durability is amazing ! I played Airstick130 and after 3 broken in one moth I took a divorce ! The only bad thing about that raquet is a grip , but it can be changed to pu karakal . I have also v120 power , its great but when you play lines you are worried about strings . Question ! Does any of you use green eye strings ? Are they much better than tecnifibre 1.2 ? <p> When bought my 120 control , I replaced the original grip inmediately . I use to do that with all the rackets , the Karakal PU grips are in other league and I do n\\'t  want to play with other grips . The owner of the store gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I bought the racket , and I \\'m going to give it a chance because it was for free and it does n\\'t  look bad , but I \\'ve got another Karakal if the Eyes one does n\\'t  work well . <p> Hi , I \\'ve tried that eye grip . As you said , a brand new looks good but after couples of hours on the court it was wasted . PU Karakal is the best ! There are some colours and some of them ( etc blue ) mark your hands . I use only yellow and I cant imagine playing a different one . <p> Hi , i \\'m about to buy this racket . Can anyone say anything more about its durability after some time od usage especially the eyelets . I just threw away my airstick team because of the same problem and i \\'m a little concerned . <p> I have this racket for about a month and I can-t ensure anything for my own experience , but a partner who is a semi-pro player ( and the one who recommended me this unbelievable racket ) is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays everyday in a high level and he told me that the durability is higher than the other rackets that he had . Another benefit in my opinion , dealing with eyelets is that you can replace only one of them without changing a great amount of pieces , and obviously it is so cheap . In the store that I use to buy the Eye products , they have eyelets which you can buy in order to replace them if you have any problem . And finally , if you want an opinion about the racket , is the best racket I-ve ever had and I ever tested , I-m really happy with my choice . <p> Thank You for fast replay . You reassured me that it is a good choice and I ordered it . I also found that eyelets are available in shops in my country ( Poland ) as well . I will post on my experience with the racket in some = <p> Hi Bartek : ) That \\'s a very good decision ! Eyelets are offered by erakiety.com but to be honest.when your x120ctrl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n\\'t  had such experience but there is no squash player without that = <p> Is the same racket with a different colorway . When Borja signed his contract with Eye , he started to play with the x.lite 120 PRO control . This racket has a quite small head size and is a direct response racket , whereas the x.lite 120 control is a touch racket . But right now he has a signature model of the x.lite 120 in red , the Shabanas one , but with a different color . <p> The factory tension for all rackets is around 26-28 lbs and the string is nylon . We contemplated supplying our rackets with X.Tech ( our premium multi-filament string ) but there are several reasons against doing that . The rackets , after production , are often transported through several climates ( humid , dry , hot , cold ) before arriving in the country of sale . It can also be anywhere from 3-12 months ( possibly longer ) before a racket ends up in the hand of a player . For these reasons , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and benefit from a re-string on delivery . The tension will be reduced and become un-even . Several brands use a premium string in the supply of their rackets , however pros/top amateurs will cut the factory \\' string out straight away and replace . <p> The factory string in our rackets is not available to purchase and instead we recommend X.Tech . <p> I tend to use the factory string until it goes ( largely because I \\'m lazy ) and find , although X.Tech makes a noticeable difference , I still get good response out of the original strings . <p> I just wanted to follow up on my experience with Eye Rackets . After ordering the X.Lite 110 Control and not liking it , I contacted Eye and was given discount for an X.Lite 120 Control . <p> I received the racket last week and weighted it right away with a PU Karakal grip that I put on and factory strings , it comes up to exactly 140 grams ( 20 less than the X.Lite 110 control with the same setup ) . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams , so 120 gram naked frame sounds exactly right . <p> Moving on the playing with it , I have to say , this is BY FAR the best racket that I \\'ve ever played with . My confidence has just skyrocketed . Deception has improved by far because the racket is so light that you can hold the ball until the last second and send it anywhere on the court . My short game always much improved as I feel that the racket has a lot of feel , despite being so light . I feel 100% confident to drop from anywhere . I really like the factory Eye string . Normally , I restring all of my rackets immediately with 18 gauge TF 305 , but I think that I \\'ll leave this one on for a while . Lastly , due to the thin head profile and lack of bumper guard , I find it much easier to scrape balls that are just glued to the wall . <p> I \\'m very happy with the purchase and will be ordering another one to have as backup when the strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the durability . I will post an update here if anything catastrophic happens in the near future . <p> I \\'m playing since march so its still to short to judge but for this moment everything is ok . I have hit the walls many times and nothing happens . I \\'m still using original strings but they might need changing soon . As far for the grip it needs to be replaced ASAP = <p> Hi Pierre , Theres a lot of really good stuff on your website . I need to point out a couple of things about your review of the eye lite 120 control and power rackets . You called the frame a classic closed throat design , its not closed , its open . Joey describes it correctly in his video , I \\'m sure that was a slip of the tongue . More importantly , the power version in your video review has been strung incorrectly with the bottom 2 cross strings missing altogether . This would greatly effect the performance of the racket and probably shift the position of the sweet spot noticeably . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as designed ) around the entire hoop , this would be likely to upset the characteristics of the frame to some extent . I think this really invalidates this particular review . It would be interesting to see the outcome of your review with the power version set up correctly , to see if you like it any better , it did n\\'t  really have a chance this time round ! <p> Hi Pierre , the open or closed throat debate is a common one . Having been a player for over 40 years , I started on wooden rackets like the maxply and grays light blue etc. they all had a long shaft and small round head ! The first big change came when some rackets were made where the shaft split a few inches before the head \" opening \" up the throat , creating the now familiar open throat triangle formed by the shaft splitting at the yoke and the bridge which holds the centre mains at the throat . These rackets were called open throat rackets . I think its simple , as there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more formally the USRSA/ ERSA Stringers Digest has a diagram of a racket in the first few pages that clearly states this type of racket is open throat . All certified stringers and Master Racquet Technicians have been examined on the contents of the digest for about the last 25 or more years . That s enough for me to be convinced ! You can get teardrop shape rackets with both open and closed throats eg , TF carboflex is closed , Prince powering rackets are open what do you reckon ? Cheers Nick . <p> Thanks for weighing those Pierre . I was also expecting around 135 myself . <p> I contacted Eye and while they do n\\'t  admit to any issues with the racket , they are willing to send me a 120 X.Lite Control at a big discount , claiming that I should be happier with it and that the 110 version is not as popular . I will report back when I get it . <p> Regardless , I would love to hear from someone else that is using the 110 to find out if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple factors you need to consider . Not all companys state the weight of the racket strung , most give the unstrung weight , so right there the 110 jumps to 125 atleast . Plus you need to factor in the weight of the grip which is probably another 15 grams . That makes 140 .. Now the last 7 grams I could n\\'t tell you : &gt; The only company I know that shows the actual weight strung of the racket is Harrow . <p> I just weighed the X lite 110 Pro Power ( I string rackets for my clubmates , and so have a mix of rackets in house from time to time ) It weighs 140grams on my digital kitchen weight . Both my X lite 120 control weighs 148grams , but that includes a thin overgrip . <p> Jostein any chance you or anyone else weighted any more 110s . I am very interested in trying a xlite pro control 110 but need to know it is indeed lighter then the 120s as I have used my son in laws 120 and it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighter racket . I weighted his at 142 g with a PU grip and Dnamx 1.15 18 g string . My Harrow is 132 g with the same set up . 132 is more my liking even balance . Enjoy the game ! <p> I can agree with you Jason . i bought the X Lite 110 Power about 2 months ago , factory strings broke within a month ( playing 3-4 times a week ) , which I replaced with my usual Ashaway Supernick XL Ti string ( thinking ) \" its ok , its a 17 guage string so should be fine \" even if its a more coarse string 4 weeks later and the centre main string was ripped to shreads and all others intact with little wear . I have now replaced with a more durable monofilament so I will have to see how long it lasts ( 2 weeks in and I can see a tiny bit of notching ! ) . I suspect less tension might be the answer if these break in the next few weeks ( but worried how it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great racket to play with ( very light , and manouvreable ) and I \\'m really pleased with it . I too was concerned about the durability of the frame , but having scuffed it a few times against the side walls , its holding up very well indeed , I am pleasently surprised ! Well done Eye ! <p> Hi guys . With a more open string pattern like the power version , there will be more movement in the string compared to the tighter control pattern . More movement means more friction and friction is the main reason that strings break . If you try a lower tension , that will increase the string movement further . You could try a higher tension to reduce movement , or consider a thicker guage string at the same tension . The thicker guage ( in the same string ) will be a little less elastic than the thinner guage , move less and reduce the friction slightly . It should last longer . Its sod s law , of course , that what you gain in durability , will be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has stood the test of time , but it has a braided coat that would exagerate the friction when the strings move . The newer ultranick and powernick from ashaway have zyex in them which beefs up there durability considerably . I would try the powernick 18 . Eye s own xtech string is good too , a pu multifilament , completely different , but comes in three guages , worth a bit of experimenting to find a good combination . Maybe ? <p> The problem with these rackets is that the grommets break off really easily because there \\'s no bumper guard that \\'s holding them in place , but instead they are all individually inserted . And their \" power \" model is awful in my opinion , you need atleast 14 main strings , any less and the feel is really bad on the racket in my opinion . Otherwise the 120 control is a pretty good racket . <p> I have to agree with Jason on the durability of the eyelets . I had a few breaking after two weeks of use . Apart from that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame is my only concern leftonly time will tell . <p> On both my Eye x lite 120 pro power some eyelets broke off easily . I have seen this more often on the \" power \" series of rackets , I guess the open string pattern increases strain on each \" grommet \" I have seen the same thing happen to some Prince airsticks , even with a more dense string pattern . <p> The good news is that the newer rackets from Eye is said to come with eyelets in a softer less breakable material . Those Eyelets can also be bought separately from Eye/UK according to their website . In my experience Eye rackets holds great customer service . <p> Nice ! Very thorough review Pierre . I am using the new Dunlop Elite GTX this season strung with 18g 305 green . I like the extra power i get from the patter as apposed to the ultimate still get tons of feel and control . How would you compare the new Elite to either of these two racquets since i \\'m a fan of this shape of racquet with a head light balance . \\n@@90399021 @5899021/ <h> Comments <p> have just restrung my two rackets ( Head Graphene Neon 130 and Prince Pro Tour 850 ) with this tiny strings . With this string in the graphene neon 130 , it feels a bit stiff ( string tension at 26.5 lbs ) but it make lots of improvement in the accuracy and control of the shots . The strings move a lot when you grip the ball and it sometimes help me to slice the ball for a drop shot in the front court . the cons of this string ( in my opinion ) is the power generation from the string bed . because it is stiff monofilament , i find my shots are powerless and not much pop sounds generated when i strike a ball to the wall ( if compared to the tecnifibre 350 1.10 green string ) . With this string in my Prince racket , it only last about a week ( i play squash at least 1-2 hours everyday ) so this string is not really preferrable on a long-stringbed type racket . But i find the resilience is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to try different strings on my rackets ( now i am using Rucanor-Gosen Hy-Sheep 1.17 string on my prince racket ) and my advice , do n\\'t  go for thinner string higher than gauge 18 if you want nice blend of control , touch , power and resilience . <p> I really enjoy this string , but like Zach found it a bit stiff and it does n\\'t  last , and the stringbed moves a good amount . My preference is the Ultranick 18 , which is a great blend of control , touch and power . And its quite durable . You get the same power as the Powernick 18 ( red ) , but with a softer feel . <p> This string is meant to be a very good all round string . Never used myself , but heard its quite good , however it has very poor durability . That \\'s the price you pay for better play ability I guess !

Since moving over to the Asics Gel Volley Elite shoe ( from Head ) , my soreness has almost gone . I play 3-4 times per week these shoes are extremely comfortable , supportive and grippy . I would HIGHLY reccomend these to anyone seeking a strong performace squash shoe . <p> I concur . These shoes are nothing short of amazing as far as balance and movement are concerned . I feel as if my lunges both forwards and backwards are quicker and more on balance . Lateral movement is a joy , as they seem to have cut down completely on the twisted ankles of before .
