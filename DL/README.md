# Deep Learning

* **Laboratory No.1 :** Introduction to Tensorflow. CNNs for Image Classification.
* **Laboratory No.2 :** CNNs for Text Classification.
* **Laboratory No.3 :** Transfer Learning.
* **Laboratory No.4 :** Long Short-Term Memory etworks (LSTM).

Grading system: All students are required to participate in the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dl-2022-medical/), and their score will determine their final grade in this course. Participants in the Kaggle competition for medical image multi-label classification were tasked with developing deep classification models without the use of a pre-trained model or additional data for use in a multi-label environment. The final score was calculated by using the mean F1-score on the test dataset.
